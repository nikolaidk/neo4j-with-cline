# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
The system follows a pipeline architecture with four main components:
1. Document Analysis (Deepseek AI)
2. XML Processing
3. Graph Database (Neo4j)
4. Self-Improvement Pipeline (Deepseek AI)

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. AI-Powered Analysis
- Using Deepseek AI for document understanding
- Structured XML output format
- Context-aware processing with rolling window

### 2. XML Processing
- Schema-driven validation
- Strict type checking
- Error recovery mechanisms
- Incremental processing capability

### 3. Graph Database
- Neo4j as primary storage
- Docker-based deployment
- Optimized memory configuration
- Relationship-centric data model

## Design Patterns

### Document Processing
- Streaming Iterator Pattern
  - Chunk-based processing
  - Memory-efficient handling
  - Context preservation

### Data Transformation
- Pipeline Pattern
  - Document → XML → Graph
  - Validation at each step
  - Error handling and recovery

### Graph Structure
- Property Graph Model
  - Concepts as nodes
  - Dependencies as relationships
  - Properties for metadata

## Technical Constraints
- Memory management for large documents
- XML validation requirements
- Neo4j performance optimization
- API rate limiting considerations

## Best Practices
1. Validation
   - XML schema validation
   - Graph consistency checks
   - Data integrity verification

2. Error Handling
   - Retry mechanisms
   - Graceful degradation
   - Error logging and monitoring

3. Performance
   - Batch processing
   - Connection pooling
   - Query optimization

4. Continuous Improvement
   - Regular code analysis
   - Automated pattern detection
   - Self-evaluation cycles
   - Improvement implementation tracking
