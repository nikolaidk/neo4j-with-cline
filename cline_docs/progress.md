# Project Progress

## What Works
- Project structure and architecture implemented
- Neo4j container deployed with organized directory structure
- Local data persistence with dedicated directories:
  - Database files in neo4j/data
  - Log files in neo4j/logs
  - Import directory in neo4j/import
  - Plugins directory in neo4j/plugins
- Docker Compose configuration with local volume mappings
- Container management script with health checks
- Document streaming and processing pipeline
- Enhanced metadata extraction and storage
- XML schema validation with rich metadata support
- Deepseek AI integration with context preservation
- Graph database connectivity with retry mechanisms
- Error recovery and logging system
- Neo4j Browser interface accessible

## What's Left to Build

### Document Analysis
- [ ] Fine-tune concept extraction
- [ ] Improve relationship detection
- [ ] Enhance context preservation

### Graph Optimization
- [ ] Configure indexes for performance
- [ ] Implement query optimizations
- [ ] Add relationship types

### Self-Improvement System
- [ ] Set up Deepseek code analysis pipeline
- [ ] Implement automated evaluation system
- [ ] Create reflection documentation workflow
- [ ] Configure regular improvement cycles

## Progress Status
- Phase: Enhanced Infrastructure Complete
- Status: Processing Documentation with Rich Metadata
- Priority: Optimizing knowledge extraction and relationships
- Blockers: None currently identified
- Recent Achievement: Implemented organized directory structure with local persistence

## Next Milestone
Enhanced knowledge graph with optimized querying capabilities and automated improvements through the self-improvement pipeline.
