# Product Context

## Purpose
This project aims to create a graph-based analysis system for Azure DevOps Boards documentation, enabling users to explore and understand use case dependencies through a Neo4j graph database interface.

## Problems Solved
1. Complex Documentation Navigation - Transforms linear documentation into an interconnected graph
2. Dependency Tracking - Makes relationships between use cases explicit and navigable
3. Knowledge Discovery - Enables exploration of related concepts and dependencies

## Intended Functionality
1. Document Processing
   - Ingest Azure DevOps Boards documentation
   - Parse and analyze content using Deepseek AI
   - Generate structured XML representations

2. Graph Database
   - Store analyzed content in Neo4j
   - Maintain relationships between concepts
   - Enable graph traversal and exploration

3. User Interface
   - Neo4j browser interface for graph exploration
   - Query capabilities for finding dependencies
   - Visual representation of relationships

4. Self-Improvement System
   - Automated code analysis using Deepseek AI
   - Regular system evaluation and reflection
   - Continuous improvement implementation
   - Pattern evolution tracking
