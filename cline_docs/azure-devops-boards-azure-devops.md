What is Azure Boards?
Article • 09/25/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Azure Boards is a web-based service that enables teams to plan, track, and discuss work
across the entire development process, while it supports agile methodologies. Azure
Boards provides a customizable platform for managing work items, allowing teams to
collaborate effectively and streamline their workflow. Sign up, customize, and experience
the benefits of using Azure Boards.
You can track and manage work and access various functions within each of the
following hubs.
Azure
Boards

Functions
Work
items
Access lists of work items based on specific criteria, such as those assigned to you,
ones you follow, and work items you viewed or updated.
Boards
View work items as cards and update their status through drag-and-drop, similar to
physical sticky notes on a whiteboard. Use this feature to implement Kanban
practices and visualize work flow for a team.
Backlogs
View, plan, order, and organize work items, including using a product backlog to
represent your project plan and a portfolio backlog to group work under features
and epics.
Sprints
Access your team's filtered view of work items based on a specific sprint or iteration
path. Assign work to a sprint using drag-and-drop from the backlog. Interact with a
backlog list or card-based Taskboard to implement Scrum practices.
Queries
Generate custom work item lists and perform various tasks, such as triage work,
make bulk updates, and view relationships between work items. Queries also allow
for creating status and trend charts that can be added to dashboards.
Delivery
Plans
Management teams can view deliverables and track dependencies across multiple
teams in a calendar view. Delivery plans support tasks such as viewing up to 15 team
backlogs, custom portfolio backlogs and epics, and work that spans several

Details
Start simply, scale as
you grow
Azure Boards offers predefined work item types for tracking features, user
stories, bugs, and tasks, making it easy to start using your product
backlog or board. It supports different Agile methods, so you can
implement the method that suits you best. You can add teams as your
organization grows to give them the autonomy to track their work as they
see fit.
Use visual,
interactive tools
Visual tools help teams quickly see and share progress with Boards,
product backlogs, built-in scrum boards and planning tools, and delivery
plans.
Customize easily
Easily configure and customize boards, Taskboards, and delivery plans
through the user interface, as well as add custom fields, work item types,
and portfolio backlogs.
Use built-in social
tools and
communication
Work item forms provide built-in discussion that you can use to capture
questions, notes, and communication as they occur. You can maintain a
history of what a team decides on any particular work item. You can also
quickly bring a team member or an entire team into the conversation by
using @mentions.
Capture information,
generous cloud
storage
Work items are designed to track all the information you need. You can
edit in rich text, drag and drop inline images, and add larger attachments
- up to 60 MB and as many as 100. Also, you can link work items within a
hierarchy or by simple related links. Each work item form maintains a
history of changes, so you can review what changed, who made the
change, and when.
Find what you need
quickly and get
notified of changes
Azure Boards provides easy-to-use tools to help you quickly find specific
work items as your project grows. You can follow work items to monitor
updates and changes, use pivot views to show work items assigned to
you, use the query engine to filter work items based on any field, and use
ad-hoc search with quick inline filters. You can also personalize your alerts
for work items that are changed or assigned to you.
Monitor status and
progress with built-
in dashboards and
analytics
With Azure Boards, you gain access to many tools to generate reports to
support tracking status and trends. By using configurable dashboards, you
can add one or more widgets. You configure widgets to display the
information and data you want, such as the following bug burndown
widget. Along with dashboards, you have access to the Analytics service.
This service is optimized for fast read-access and server-based
aggregations. By using Analytics views and Power BI, you can create highly
sophisticated reports on the project data of interest.
Integrate with Office
Project managers who want to use familiar tools can import and export
work item queries to and from Microsoft Office Excel or import and export
work items using .csv files. For more information, see Bulk import or

Extend functionality
You can gain even greater functionality by adding Marketplace extensions,
many of which are free. An extension is an installable unit that adds
capabilities to Visual Studio, Azure DevOps Services, or Visual Studio
Code. You can find extensions within these products or in the Visual
Studio Marketplace
, Azure DevOps tab. Also, by using the REST API, you
can create your own extensions or tools to integrate with Azure DevOps
Services.
Get updates via a
mobile browser
It's easy to stay on top of changes as they occur, using the mobile
browser, you can be notified and respond to changes made to work items.
Start for free
You can start for free and add up to five free users and unlimited
stakeholders.
For more information, see our Training module, What is Azure Boards?
You can connect Azure Boards with GitHub repositories to link GitHub commits, pull
requests, branches, and issues to work items. Use GitHub for software development and
Azure Boards to plan and track work. Quickly open linked GitHub commits, pull
requests, or issues from the board. For more information, see GitHub & Azure Boards.
For more information, see About default processes and process templates.
Dashboards provide teams with customized views for status updates, progress tracking,
and trend analysis. Teams can share information and improve workflows with flexible
and tailored dashboard options.

With Azure Boards, you gain the advantage of full integration with the Azure DevOps
platform. Azure DevOps is designed to provide end-to-end traceability, tracking work
from requirements to deployment. Gain insight at each step of decision making and
software deployment. Some of the traceability tasks supported include:
Create a branch from a requirement
Create a pull request of updated branch
Validate the pull request using a build pipeline
Create and run inline tests on requirements
Merge the pull request into the main, default branch
Deploy changes into production with deployment status to Azure Boards
Monitor and report on requirements traceability
For more information, see End-to-end traceability and Cross-service integration and
collaboration overview.
Gain visibility through end-to-end traceability


# Page 10

A team in Azure Boards is a group of project members who work in a specific product
area represented by hierarchical paths called Area Paths. Define teams by their name,
members, and area paths and are essential for configuring Boards, Backlogs, Sprints,
and Delivery Plans in Azure Boards. For more information, see About teams and Agile
tools.
Azure Boards integrates with popular chat tools such as Microsoft Teams and Slack
through ChatOps. It also offers extensions that add new capabilities to your projects and
can be found in the Azure DevOps Marketplace
. These extensions can help with
planning and tracking work items, sprints, scrums, and other project management tasks,
as well as collaboration among team members.
You might notice some changes in the user experience of Azure Boards. These updates
are part of the new Azure Boards, designed to provide a faster interface, improve
accessibility, and ensure consistency with other areas of the product.
The core functionality of Azure Boards remains the same. It still contains the features
you know and love such as Boards, Backlogs, Sprints, Queries, and Delivery Plans.
However, the user experience is refined to align with the rest of Azure DevOps. User
interface changes include increased spacing between elements and strategically placed
scroll bars to enhance accessibility.

Best practices for Agile project
management
Article • 10/16/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Azure Boards provides a choice of Agile planning tools, many of which work in
combination with each other. This article provides a get-started guide for project
managers new to Azure Boards. If you and your teams want to take a minimal tracking
approach to plan and manage your projects, start with this guide. Also, if you're moving
from waterfall project management to Agile methods, start with this guide.
Most of the guidance in this article is valid for both the cloud and on-premises versions.
However, some of the features included in this article, such as Rollup, Analytics, and
some portfolio planning tools, are only available for the cloud at this time.
Azure Boards provides each team with a set of Agile tools to plan and track work. Each
project defines a default team, which you can start using immediately. If you have
several development or feature teams, we recommend that you define a team in Azure
DevOps for each feature team. This way, each team can work autonomously while
collaborating with each other.
Best practice tips:
Configure teams along the value streams that your organization wants to deliver.
Define a team for each development group of 6 to 12 developers.
Configure development teams to support rollup to project management feature
teams.
For more information about configuring teams, see:
Configure a hierarchy of teams
Create or add a team
７ Note
If your team is committed to practicing Kanban or Scrum methods, see About
Boards and Kanban or the tutorials for implementing Scrum.
Configure your teams


# Page 13

Adopt an Agile culture
Scale Agile to large teams
Sprints specified by iteration paths are defined for a project and then selected by teams.
A sprint cadence can vary between one week to four weeks or longer. Also, you can
define sprints within a hierarchy that includes release trains. You assign work to sprints
that teams commit to deliver at the end of the sprint. These Azure Boards tools rely on
sprint assignments to a team's Sprint backlogs, Taskboard, and Forecast and Delivery
plans. For more information, see Implement Scrum practices and Review team delivery
plans.
Best practice tips:
Define a sprint cadence for use by all teams within your product group.
Define at least six or more iterations that support planning for the next 6 to 12
months.
Determine how teams use iterations to manage backlog items.
Unassigned sprint work is assigned to the default backlog.
Unassigned sprint work is assigned to a designated future backlog sprint.
For more information about configuring sprints, see:
Define and assign iteration paths
Define iteration paths and configure team iterations
Determine which work item types your team can use to capture customer requirements
and development work. If your project is based on the Agile process, we recommend
that you use the User Story, Bug, and Feature work item types.
If your project is based on another process, such as Basic, Scrum, or Capability Maturity
Model Integration (CMMI), you have the following choices. Each team determines how
they want to track bugs.
The following image shows the hierarchy for the Agile process backlog work item:
Configure your sprints
Choose your work item types
Agile process


# Page 14

User Stories and tasks are used to track work.
Bugs track code defects.
Epics and features are used to group work under larger scenarios.
Each team can configure how they manage Bug work items at the same level as
User Story or Task work items. Use the Working with bugs setting. For more
information about using these work item types, see Agile process.
Best practice tips:
Use the Feature work item type to capture customer features you want to ship.
Quickly add features or requirements from the backlog and fill in details later.
Use the Requirement work item type to break down features into work that the
development team owns. In addition:
For Agile, use the User Story work item type.
For Basic, use the Issue work item type.
For Scrum, use the Product backlog item work item type.
For CMMI, use the Requirement work item type.
Use the Bug work item type to capture code defects.
７ Note
Requirements specify expectations of users for a software product. In Azure Boards,
requirements are defined by work items that appear on your product backlog.
Based on the process selected for your project, requirements correspond to User
Story (Agile), Product backlog item (Scrum), Issue (Basic), or Requirement (CMMI)
work item types. They also belong to the Requirements category, which manages
the work item types that appear on the product backlog.


# Page 15

Map requirements to features to track progress at the project management level.
Size requirements to be completed within a sprint.
Size features to be completed within a sprint or several sprints.
Size Epic work items to be delivered quarterly or to some milestone objective.
Let developers use the Task category to break down their work as needed.
As a project manager, you manage the features. The development team manages the
requirements. When you map them by using parent-child links, you gain visibility into
the progress of your features. Each work item you add to your team backlog is
automatically assigned the default area path and iteration path set for your team.
If you have larger initiatives or scenarios that require shipping several features, group
them under the Epic category by using parent-child links.
For more information about work item types, see:
Define features and epics
Create your backlog
Organize your backlog
Create your product plan by using the features backlog. The development team then
creates their product plan by using the product backlog. Periodically, you should review
and refine your product plans.
Project managers initiate the product plan by adding features to the features backlog.
Each feature should represent a shippable deliverable that addresses a customer need.
Create your product plan
Features backlog


# Page 16

Development teams add User Stories to their product backlog. The User Story is
automatically assigned the team's default area path and iteration path. Then, the team
map those stories under each feature that represents the work required to implement
the feature. You should size each User Story so that it can be completed within a sprint.
Product backlog


# Page 17

Periodically review each backlog by doing the following tasks:
Define the work to be performed.
Reorder work items by using the drag-and-drop method so that they appear in
priority order.
Open work items and add details.
Assign work to team members or to sprints.
Capture technical debt and nonfeature work required to support a healthy
ecosystem of delivery.
Map unparented work to the features to which it belongs.
Estimate the size of the requirements to help determine team velocity and support
forecasting (optional).
Best practice tips:
Periodically refine your backlog.
Make sure features and requirements are sized appropriately.
Define the acceptance criteria and the definition of done for features and work.
Map unmapped work to features.
Set your view options to support the backlog tasks you want to accomplish.
Forecast your backlog.
For more information, see:
Define features and epics
Create your backlog
Configure your backlog view
Forecast your product backlog
Refine each backlog
 Tip
You can monitor team velocity based on estimates assigned to completed work or
a simple count of work items completed during sprints. To use the Forecast feature,
you must assign a value to the Story Points, Effort, or Size field. If you don't want
to estimate requirements, you can simply assign a value of 1 to requirement
estimates and then use the Forecast tool based on a count of work items.
Use tags to support queries and filtering


# Page 18

With work item tags, team members can assign ad-hoc tags to work items. You can use
these tags to filter backlogs and boards. You can also use them to query on work items.
For tags to be useful to the team, provide some general guidance on how your team
should use tags. Consider documenting this guidance in a central place, such as the
project wiki.
The following image illustrates a board filtered on the web keyword that displays cards
with the Web  tag.
Best practice tips:
Have a policy in place about how your teams use tags.
Indicate how you use tags to support queries, filtering, and reporting.
Consider using tags to identify cross-team or cross-project dependencies.
For more information, see:
Add work item tags to categorize and filter lists and boards
Filter your board
Create a wiki for your project
To gain insight into what features can ship when, use the Forecast tool. This tool
requires that you provide estimates to the Story Points, Effort, or Size field for each
requirement. If you want to forecast on a simple count of work items, assign the value of
1 to requirement estimates.
Forecast and milestone planning
Order the features backlog in priority order


# Page 19

As a project manager, you should always have your features backlog in priority order,
which conveys to the development team which features are most important to complete
first.
Here, the features backlog shows the sequence of features to ship.
Make sure that you complete the requirements needed to ship features. As shown in the
following image, the requirements backlog is ordered according to the features you
want to ship. This ordering assumes that all requirements in a feature must be complete
to ship it. Also, Story Points are assigned to each User Story.
Order the requirements backlog based on parent features


# Page 20

With estimates assigned to each requirement, you can set a team velocity. The following
example specifies 12 for the velocity, which is equivalent to stating that on average the
team can complete 12 Story Points per sprint. The Forecast tool shows which
requirements and features the team can complete within the next six sprints. When you
use the Planning tool, you can assign requirements to the forecasted sprints.
Forecast the requirements backlog



# Page 21

Getting good at estimates and having predictable team velocities are useful team goals
for process improvement.
With a forecast of when a feature ships, you can update each feature's iteration path.
Assign values to a feature by adding those fields to the card on the board, as shown in
the following image.
Milestone markers aren't used in Azure Boards work tracking, except for delivery plans.
Delivery plans provide a calendar view and allow you to define a milestone marker. For
more information, see Review team delivery plans in Azure Boards.
You can use one or more of the following options to mark a work item as a milestone:
Update your Features board
Milestone planning


# Page 22

Prepend or append the word Milestone in the title of your work item.
Add a work item tag labeled Milestone.
Add a custom field labeled Milestone and populate it with a pick list of milestones.
Link work items by using the Predecessor/Successor or Related link type to a
milestone work item.
Assign a milestone work item to the sprint targeted for completion.
In Microsoft Project, you manage tasks that depend on the completion of other tasks by
linking them. To manage dependencies in Azure Boards, you can add similar linking by
adding Predecessor/Successor link types to work items. Add these links from the Add
link dialog for a work item.
Azure Boards supports many link types to track related work. Choose the
Predecessor/Successor link types to track work with dependencies. A quick way to link
work items is to add a tag to work items that participate in producing or consuming
dependencies. Create a query that uses the tag, and then add the required links.
The following Add link dialog illustrates how two work items are linked by using the
Successor link type.
Manage dependencies
Add link dialog


# Page 23

You can view dependencies and identify dependencies that have issues with delivery
plans. As shown in the following image, you can toggle the display of dependency lines
between linked work items. For more information, see Track dependencies by using
delivery plans.
Visualize work item relationships


# Page 24

Azure Boards doesn't provide a native view of the critical path. Agile methodologies
favor a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) over Critical Path Management. By using MVP,
you identify the shortest path and dependencies by prioritizing Epic, Feature, User Story,
and Task work item types. For more context, see The critical path on Agile projects
and Running a lean startup on Azure DevOps
.
Best practice tips:
Add a dependency  tag to work items participating in dependency management.
Use Predecessor/Successor link types to track dependencies of work owned by
other teams or within other projects.
Create queries to track, add, and triage dependencies.
Use delivery plans to view work that you have dependencies on from other teams.
Use the Work Item Visualization
 Marketplace extension to visualize
dependencies for a specific work item within the work item form.
Minimum Viable Product vs. Critical Path Management
７ Note


# Page 25

For more information, see:
Link work items to objects
Track dependencies by using delivery plans
Sprints allow the development team to focus on completing a preselected set of work.
Work assigned to a sprint appears on the team's sprint backlog. Sprint backlogs are
defined only for product backlogs, not for portfolio backlogs.
By updating the status of work daily throughout a sprint, you can easily track sprint
progress with the Sprint burndown chart, as shown in the following image.
Best practice tips:
For each sprint, perform the following tasks:
Plan each sprint with your team.
Use the team's sprint backlog to review sprint deliverables.
Ensure that each sprint work item is assigned to a team member.
Marketplace extensions aren't supported features of Azure Boards, so they aren't
supported by the product team. For questions, suggestions, or issues you have
when you use these extensions, see their corresponding extension pages.
Work in sprints



# Page 26

Ensure that each work item is scoped for completion within the sprint.
Ensure that the acceptance criteria for the work are well defined and understood.
Update the status of sprint work items as work moves from New to Active to
Completed states, tracking sprint burndown.
Check in with other teams on dependencies on which your team's work depends.
Monitor sprint progress by using the sprint burndown chart.
For more information, see:
Assign backlog items to a sprint
Configure and monitor sprint burndown
Define features and epics
The three main tools you should use to review progress and deliverables are:
Features board
Features backlog with rollup columns
Delivery plans
Your Features board is another place to review progress and ensure the continuous flow
of deliverables. The following image illustrates a customized Features board, including
in-progress columns like Need more info, On Deck, In Progress, and Customer Rollout.
These columns provide a more natural set of states as features get proposed,
researched, designed, developed, and then deployed to production.
Review progress and feature deliverables
Features board

Rollup


# Page 27

One quick and visual way to monitor progress is from the features backlog. By adding
the rollup progress bar column, you can see what percentage of work items are
completed for each feature, as shown in the following image.
To review features delivered across several teams, configure a delivery plan. Delivery
plans provide an interactive board to review a calendar schedule of stories or features
that several teams plan to deliver.
Best practice tips:
Delivery plans and multiple team deliverables


# Page 28

Customize your Features board to support your team's processes.
Add fields to cards so that you can update their values quickly and easily.
Update the iteration path (sprint) of features as you gain clarity about when they
ship.
Review the Features board to talk through status, blocks/issues/risks/changes, and
update status.
Use the filter feature to focus on tagged items, assigned-by features, specific
sprints, and more.
Add rollup columns to your feature backlog to monitor overall progress based on
work item count completion.
Use delivery plans to review features for several teams to discuss cross-team
dependencies.
For more information, see:
Manage columns on your board
Customize cards
Filter your board

Review team delivery plans
Continuous improvement is at the heart of Agile methods. To improve your processes,
you need to have shared goals and a shared plan. To initiate process improvement
activities, consider adding them through regular practices. You might want to:
Plan sprints.
Set sprint goals.
Conduct regular retrospectives.
Consider the following questions when you set goals:
What are you learning about your customers? What do you need to know?
What data is being measured? Is it actionable? What data needs to be measured?
How is the flow of deliverables? Is it as expected? Where can improvements be
made?
Are your team members empowered to do their best? What tools or information
would help them improve?
How well is information being shared? How well are teams collaborating?
How well is your team managing technical debt and closing bugs?
Process improvement


# Page 29

Some of the Agile tools you can use to support process improvement are team velocity,
team dashboards, and the Retrospectives
 Marketplace extension.
From the team's Velocity chart, you can gain an understanding about how well the team
is planning and executing a sprint. As shown in the following example, the Velocity chart
shows the planned, completed, completed late, and incomplete count of work items for
several sprints. Teams can review this chart to help determine how well they're
estimating and executing and how they might improve.
Teams can define dashboards to share information and monitor real-time data on work
progress.
Team velocity
Team dashboards


# Page 30

Best practice tips:
Identify process improvement goals that your team can agree to, write them down,
and review them periodically.
Use team dashboards to share information and work tracking charts, which you
and your team review periodically.
Have your team identify at least one sprint goal related to process improvement
while at sprint planning meetings.
Conduct regular retrospectives to capture what went well, what didn't go well, and
actions to improve.
Maintain an improvement tracking board, such as the one that's available with the
Retrospectives
 Marketplace extension.

Plan and track work in Azure Boards
Article • 11/18/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
In this article, learn how to use Azure Boards to plan and track your work using an Agile,
Basic, Scrum, or Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) process. For more
information, see About processes and process templates.
The Agile process uses various work item types such as user stories, tasks, bugs,
features, and epics to plan and track work. Begin by adding user stories and
grouping them into features if needed. You can add tasks to a user story to track
more details.
Work item types
Backlog hierarchy
In each work item form, you can describe the work to be done, assign work to
project contributors, track status, and collaborate with others through the
Agile process

Discussion section. This article describes how to add user stories and child tasks
from the web portal and add details to those work items.
Access levels:
To add work items to a board and use all other board features, have at least
Basic access.
Private project: To view boards, open and modify work items, and add child
tasks to a checklist, have at least Stakeholder access. You can't reorder or
reparent a backlog item using drag-and-drop. You can't update a field on a
card.
Public project: For full access to all Boards features, have at least Stakeholder
access.
Permissions: Be a member of the Contributors or Project Administrators group.
For more information, see Default permissions and access for Azure Boards.
A board is provisioned with the addition of each project and each team. You can only
create or add boards to a project by adding another team. For more information, see
About teams and Agile tools.
1. Sign in to your organization ( https://dev.azure.com/{Your_Organization} ) and go
to your project.
2. Select Boards > Boards.
Prerequisites
Open your board


# Page 43

3. Select a board from the All Team Boards dropdown menu.
Work items on your board are automatically assigned the default Area Path and
Iteration Path assigned to the team. For more information, see Manage and configure
team tools.

Enter a description of 255 characters or less. You can always modify the title later.
Agile process
Field descriptions


# Page 46

Assigned To
Assign the work item to the team member responsible for performing the work.
Depending on the context you're working in, the drop-down menu lists only team
members or contributors to the project.
State
When the work item is created, the State defaults to the first state in the workflow. As
work progresses, update it to reflect the current status.
Reason
Use the default first. Update it when you change state as need. Each State is associated
with a default reason.
Area (Path)
Choose the area path associated with the product or team, or leave blank until assigned
during a planning meeting. To change the dropdown list of areas, see Define area paths
and assign to a team.
Iteration (Path)
Choose the sprint or iteration in which the work is to be completed, or leave it blank and
assign it later during a planning meeting. To change the drop-down list of iterations, see
Define iteration paths and configure team iterations.
７ Note
You can only assign work to a single user. If you need to assign work to more than
one user, add a work item for each user and distinguish the work to be done by
title and description. The Assigned To field only accepts user accounts that have
been added to a project or team.


# Page 47

Description
Provide enough detail to create shared understanding of scope and support estimation
efforts. Focus on the user, what they want to accomplish, and why. Don't describe how
to develop the product. Do provide sufficient details so that your team can write tasks
and test cases to implement the item.
Acceptance Criteria
Provide the criteria to be met before the work item can be closed. Define what "Done"
means by describing the criteria for the team to use to verify whether the backlog item
or bug fix is fully implemented. Before work begins, describe the criteria for customer
acceptance as clearly as possible. Have conversations between the team and customers
to determine the acceptance criteria. These criteria help ensure a common
understanding within the team to meet customers' expectations. Also, this information
provides the basis for acceptance testing.
Priority
A subjective rating of the issue or task it relates to the business. You can specify the
following values:
1: Product can't ship without the successful resolution of the work item, and it
should be addressed as soon as possible.
2: Product can't ship without the successful resolution of the work item, but it
doesn't need to be addressed immediately.
3: Resolution of the work item is optional, based on resources, time, and risk.
4: Resolution of the work item isn't required.
Value Area
A subjective rating of the issue or task it relates to the business. You can specify the
following values:
Architectural: Technical services to implement business features that deliver
solution.
Business: Services that fulfill customers or stakeholder needs that directly deliver
customer value to support the business (Default).


# Page 48

Effort, Story Points, Size
Provide a relative estimate of the amount of work required to complete an issue. Most
Agile methods recommend that you set estimates for backlog items based on relative
size of work. Such methods include powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8) and the Fibonacci sequence
(1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.). Use any numeric unit of measurement your team prefers.
The estimates you set are used to calculate team velocity and forecast sprints.
The State field tracks the status of a work item. With the board, you can quickly update
the status of backlog items by dragging and dropping them to a different column.
As work begins, drag the user story card from the Backlog column to the Active
column. When work is ready for review, move it to the Resolved column. After a
team member reviews and accepts it, move it to the Closed column.
Task checklists provide a quick and easy way to track elements of work that are
important to complete a backlog item. Also, you can assign individual tasks to different

Work items support planning and tracking work. Each work item is based on a work item
type. Each work item is assigned an identifier, which is unique in an organization or
project collection.
Different work items track different types of work. The work item types available are
based on the process that was used when your project was created. The options are
Agile, Basic, Scrum, or Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), as illustrated in the
following images. For more information, see About work items and work item types.
The following image shows the hierarchy for the Agile process backlog work item:
User Stories and tasks are used to track work.

Default processes and process
templates
Article • 10/14/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Azure Boards offers various processes for managing work items. Selecting the right
process helps optimize project workflow and ensure your project's success. In this
article, explore the different processes available with Azure Boards. This article provides
guidance on how to choose the most suitable process for your project.
When you create a project, you choose a process or process template based on the
process model for which your organization or collection was created. Before you choose
a process for your project, you should understand the following terms.
Term
Description
Process
model
Refers to the model used to support projects created for an organization or project
collection. Only one process model is supported for a project at a time.
Process
Defines the building blocks of the work item tracking system and supports the
Inheritance process model for Azure Boards. This model supports customization of
projects through a What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) user interface.
Process
template
Defines the building blocks of the work item tracking system and other subsystems
you access through Azure DevOps. Process templates are only used with the Hosted
XML and On-premises XML process models. You can customize projects by
modifying and importing process template XML definition files.
The default process types are Basic, Agile, Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI),
and Scrum. The work tracking objects in the default processes and process templates are
the same. They're summarized in this article.
The default processes differ mainly in the work item types they provide for planning and
tracking work. The default processes are:
Basic: Is the most lightweight and is in a selective preview.
Scrum: Is the next most lightweight.
Agile: Supports many Agile method terms.
ﾉ
Expand table
Default processes


# Page 65

CMMI: Provides the most support for formal processes and change management.
Basic
Choose Basic when your team wants the simplest model that uses Issue, Task, and Epic
work item types to track work.
Tasks support tracking Remaining Work.
Agile
Choose Agile when your team uses Agile planning methods, including Scrum, and tracks
development and test activities separately. This process works great for tracking User
Stories and, optionally, bugs on the board. You can also track bugs and tasks on the
taskboard.
For more information about Agile methodologies, see Agile Alliance.
Tasks support tracking Original Estimate, Remaining Work, and Completed Work.
７ Note
The Basic process is available with Azure DevOps Server 2019 Update 1
 and later
versions.


# Page 66

Scrum
Choose Scrum when your team practices Scrum. This process works great for tracking
product backlog items and bugs on the board. You can also break down product
backlog items and bugs into tasks on the taskboard.
This process supports the Scrum methodology as defined by the Scrum organization.
Tasks support tracking Remaining Work only.
CMMI
Choose CMMI when your team follows more formal project methods that require a
framework for process improvement and an auditable record of decisions. With this
process, you can track requirements, change requests, risks, and reviews.


# Page 67

This process supports formal change management activities. Tasks support tracking
Original Estimate, Remaining Work, and Completed Work.
If you need more than two or three backlog levels, add more based on the process
model that you use:
Inheritance: Customize your backlogs or boards for a process
Hosted XML or On-premises XML: Add portfolio backlogs
The default processes are designed to meet the needs of most teams. If your team has
unusual needs and connects to an on-premises server, customize a process and then
create the project. You can also create a project from a process and then customize the
project.
The following table summarizes the main distinctions between the work item types and
states used by the four default processes.

Notes:
1. Add work items from the product backlog or board. The product backlog shows a
single view of the current backlog of work that can be dynamically reordered and
grouped. Product owners can prioritize work and outline dependencies and
relationships. Each team can configure how they want bugs to show up on their
backlogs and boards.
2. Define a hierarchy of portfolio backlogs to understand the scope of work across
several teams and see how that work rolls up into broader initiatives. Each team
configures which portfolio backlogs appear for their use.
3. Define tasks from the sprint backlog and taskboard. With capacity planning, teams
can determine if they're over capacity or under capacity for a sprint.
Workflow states support tracking the status of work as it moves from a New  state to a
Closed  or a Done  state. Each workflow consists of a set of states, the valid transitions
between the states, and the reasons for transitioning the work item to the selected state.
Workflow states, transitions, and reasons


# Page 70

The following diagrams show the typical forward progression of those work item types
used to track work and code defects for the three default processes. They also show
some of the regressions to former states and transitions to removed states.
Each image shows only the default reason associated with the transition.
User Story
Feature
） Important
For Azure DevOps Services and Azure DevOps Server 2019, the default workflow
transitions support any state to any state transition. Customize these workflows to
restrict some transitions. For more information, see Customize your work tracking
experience.
View the supported workflow transitions for each work item type by installing the
State Model Visualization
 Marketplace extension. This extension adds a new hub
under Boards labeled State Visualizer. On that page, choose a work item type and
view the workflow state model.

# Page 72

Task
Most work item types used by Agile tools, the ones that appear on backlogs and boards,
support any-to-any transitions. Update the status of a work item by using the board or
the taskboard. Drag a work item to its corresponding state column.
Change the workflow to support other states, transitions, and reasons. For more
information, see Customize your work tracking experience.
When you change the state of a work item to Removed , Closed , or Done , the system
responds as follows:
Closed  or Done : Work items in this state don't appear on the portfolio backlog and
backlog pages. They do appear on the sprint backlog pages, board, and taskboard.
When you change the portfolio backlog view to Show backlog items, for example,
Work item states


# Page 73

to view features to product backlog items, work items in the Closed  and Done
state appear.
Removed : Work items in this state don't appear on any backlog or board.
Your project maintains work items as long as the project is active. Even if you set work
items to Closed , Done , or Removed , the data store keeps a record. Use a record to create
queries or reports.
If you need to permanently delete work items, see Remove or delete work items.
The following work item types are added to all processes except the Basic process.
Your team can create and work with these types by using the corresponding tool.

Completed or closed work items don't display on the backlogs and boards after
their Changed Date value is greater than 183 days (about a half a year). You can
still list these items by using a query. If you want them to show up on a backlog or
board, you can make a minor change to them, which resets the clock.

Promote an Agile culture within your
team
Article • 11/16/2023
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
As your team grows, you want your tools to grow with it. And if you're an enterprise
adopting Agile methodologies, you want your Agile tools to support the business goals
of your enterprise.
However, successfully scaling Agile requires addressing both the culture and tools within
your organization.
Organizations that aspire to be agile need to consider the twin obligations of creating
alignment across the enterprise and supporting team autonomy. A team needs
autonomy to be efficient. And enterprises need alignment across teams and the
organization to be efficient.
Too much alignment with insufficient team autonomy leads doesn't support innovation
or agility of teams to get things done. Too little alignment with each team running their
own program doesn't provide the insight and coordination required to meet business
goals.
With the right level of alignment across the organization and team autonomy,
individuals get empowered to innovate and inspired to collaborate to meet business
goals.
As you plan how you want to grow your Agile tool set, consider the following areas.
These areas are key to creating enterprise alignment while developing team autonomy.
７ Note
New to Agile? For more information, see Agile Culture and Scaling Agile to Large
Teams.
Enable autonomy
Create alignment


# Page 76

Area
Create alignment
Support autonomy
Product vision
The organization defines the goals and roadmap for the organization. You can define
goals as epics and features that show up on the portfolio backlog.
A team determines how to best meet the roadmap. The team breaks down goals into
user stories or product backlog items using their team backlogs.
Team structure
Based on business goals, organizations determine the number and size of teams.
Vertically structured feature teams lead to greater autonomy and efficiency.
With teams, there should be some established roles, such as product owner and
development leads, but also room to rotate roles. For example, team members can take
turns acting as Scrum Master, developing sprint demos, running sprint retrospectives, or
crafting sprint emails.
Development cadence
Agile organizations need to release products and feature updates at regular intervals.
Establishing regular release and sprint schedules promotes the rhythm of the business.
Each sprint--a time boxed iteration of constant duration between two and four weeks—
includes planning, executing, delivering value, reflecting, and engaging in continuous
improvement.
All teams manage their work within the set sprint cadence. The team provides input into
the length of sprint that works best for them.
The team chooses the Agile methods that work for them, Scrum, Kanban, or a mix of
both. The team also takes ownership of starting and acting on their own set of
continuous improvement practices.
It's possible for some teams to execute in shorter sprints. For example, if an organization
sets a 2-week sprint cadence, some teams may choose to operate in 1-week sprints,
while still aligning with the organizational schedule.
Communication cadence


# Page 77

Just as sprints bring a natural rhythm to the flow of work, so too do regular
communications. By setting expectations for the types of communications they want to
see to stay aligned and how often they occur, organizations naturally create alignment
across teams and the enterprise.
Team sprint emails, bug bar status, and release team feature delivery status are
examples of such regular communications.
A team determines the details that they communicate and who develops the
communication. Their sprint emails may contain a summary of previous sprint
accomplishments and the next sprint plans or include a demo of recently completed
features.
Quality
Each organization needs to set the criteria and standards by which they assess quality
and set expectations for quality standards. A few ways they define the criteria are to set
exit criteria for new feature development, standards to manage technical debt, and bug
caps for teams or individuals.
Also, they can monitor bug status and trends by creating bug dashboards.
A team chooses how they meet the quality standards. They may stage bug bashes for
new features or at the end of each sprint. They may choose an individual to function as
a bug shield on a rotating basis.
Manage risk, track work
The organization determines how each functional unit communicates status and risk.
They establish a "contract of communication" as to the minimum required information
the organization needs.
Also, the organization provides the infrastructure to reduce risks. The organization owes
the teams anything they can do to reduce risks that are common across teams.
Beyond meeting the needs set by the organization, teams determine any other details
they need to manage and track to reduce their risks. Whether they use a white board
with sticky notes or a full Gantt chart, they manage the details. For example, teams may
add a backlog item to track a dependency they have on another team. Or they may
track their risks via a list of issues or impediments. Also, teams regularly contribute to
improving the process and infrastructure to support the organization's ability to manage
risk and gain insights.
Structure teams


# Page 78

As you scale, one of the most important tasks to consider is how you structure your
teams. Traditionally, horizontal team structures divide teams according to the software
architecture: user interface, service-oriented architecture, and data teams.
However, with the adoption of Agile practices, vertical team structures that span the
architecture provide greater team autonomy. Vertical teams can deliver on the features
they own by working across the software architecture. They also spread the knowledge
needed to work at all architecture levels throughout all the teams.
Configure your teams along the value streams that your organization wants to deliver.
For example, Fabrikam Fiber, organizes their teams into the following seven feature
teams.
Each team plans the features to deliver. They have the autonomy to determine how to
structure the data, architect the services, and design the web and mobile user interfaces.
They plan in adherence with the quality standards set by the organization and to which
all teams contribute.
As your organization grows, you can scale your Agile tools in the following ways.
Add teams and filtered backlog views: You add teams to support team autonomy
and provide them with the tools they can configure and manage that supports
Configure your Agile tools to scale


# Page 79

how they want to work. These tools include product backlogs, boards, sprint
backlogs, Taskboards, and others.
Also, you can configure teams to support a hierarchy of backlogs and portfolio
backlogs so that portfolio managers can review priority and progress across
several teams.
Set up sprints and releases: You can structure your iterations to support a flat set
of sprints, or a set of sprints embedded within scheduled releases. Each team
activates the set of sprints and releases that they need to participate in.
Manage portfolios: by setting up a hierarchy of teams and backlogs and activating
portfolio backlogs. Feature teams focused on a subset of the product backlog can
remain focused on just their backlog. Portfolio managers who want to view and
organize backlogs to track progress and dependencies can manage portfolio
backlogs of Features and Epics.
If you need other portfolio backlogs, for example, Scenarios or Initiatives, you can
add them as well.
Configure dashboards: With team dashboards, you can configure charts that track
progress within a team or across teams. Specifically, you can add status and trend
charts based on queries you create.
Group or categorize work: There are several ways to group work that you want to
track. Backlogs filter work items based on team area assignments. And portfolio
backlogs allow you to group backlog items under Features and Epics.
If you want to track and report on work items based on other groupings, you can.
You can add tags to work items and then filter backlogs or queries based on tags.
Also, you can add subarea paths to represent more granular feature areas.
Add folders and use team favorites: As your teams grow, you see a growing list of
work item queries, build definitions, and source code folders. By using folders,
subfolders, and team favorites, you can manage many of these lists more easily.
You can add team favorites for shared queries, source code, and build definitions.
Often, organizations look at adding a project for each software development project.
We recommend that you add teams to scale your tools rather than add projects for the
following reasons:
Scale with teams and not projects

Agile process work item types
Article • 03/25/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
The Agile process supports the following work item types (WITs) to plan and track work,
tests, feedback, and code review. With different WITs you can track different types of
work—such as features, user stories, and tasks. These artifacts get created when you
create a project using the Agile process and are based on Agile principles and values.
Along with the WITs, teams have access to a set of work item queries to track
information, analyze progress, and make decisions.
Build your project plan by creating a backlog of user stories that represent the work you
want to develop and ship. You track bugs, tasks, and blocking issues using the bug, task,
７ Note
You can customize the work tracking system for your project by creating and
customizing an inherited process and applying that process to your project. For
more information, see Inheritance process model.
Plan and track work with Agile


# Page 82

and issue WITs. To support portfolio management, teams create features and epics to
view a rollup of user stories within or across teams. For details about using Agile WITs,
see Agile process work item types and workflow.
The following image shows the essential flow for getting started. For more information,
see Get started with Agile tools to plan and track work.
Select one of the following images to go to the linked article.
You can manage your workload more effectively by frequently reviewing the status of
user stories and tasks. You can use the shared work item queries to list work items for a
current sprint or the product backlog.
７ Note
A work item is a database record that contains the definition, assignment, priority,
and state of work. Work item types define the template of fields, workflow, and
form for each type. Work items can be linked to each other to support tracking
dependencies, roll up of work, and reports.
List work items by using queries
７ Note


# Page 83

You can view and run queries from the web portal or from the Team Explorer plug-in to
Visual Studio. You can also modify a query using the query editor to apply different filter
criteria and add queries to team dashboards.
Manage work more effectively with the following tips:
Find work items assigned to you by adding @Me as the value for the Assigned To
field in one of the query clauses.
Modify any query by adding criteria to focus on a product area, an iteration, or
another field. To modify a query, open the query editor.
Open any query in Excel where you can update the fields of one or more work
items and publish your changes to the database for tracking work items.
Visualize status or progress by creating a pie-chart, column chart, or trend chart for
flat-list queries.
All valid users with standard access can create queries and folders under the My
Queries area. To create queries and query folders under Shared Queries, you must
have the Contribute permission set and have been assigned Basic access or
greater. For more information, see Set permissions on queries.
All processes—Agile, Scrum, and CMMI—support building status and trend charts and
dashboards. Also, several charts are automatically built based on the Agile tools you use.
These charts display within the web portal.
When you create a new project, there's no longer a default set of Shared Queries.
The definitions for Shared Queries were removed from the process template. For
on-premises deployments, you can add them to a custom process template as
described in Add work item queries to a process template.
Tips for shared queries
） Important
Starting with Visual Studio 2019, the Azure DevOps plug-in for Office has
deprecated support for Microsoft Project. Project integration and the
TFSFieldMapping command is not supported for Azure DevOps Server 2019 and
later versions, including Azure DevOps Services. You can continue to use Microsoft
Excel.
Monitor progress


# Page 84

You can define a shared flat query and create a chart based on your tracking interests.
Chart types include status—pie, bar, column, stacked bar, and pivot—and trend—
stacked area, line, and area—charts.
The Analytics Service can answer quantitative questions about the past or present state
of your projects. You can add Analytics widgets to a dashboard or use Power BI to create
charts and reports.

Agile workflow in Azure Boards
Article • 06/02/2023
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
When you use the Agile process in Azure Boards, the following work item types (WITs)
help your team to plan and track progress of your projects: epics, features, user stories,
tasks, issues/bugs. Once you define your WITs, you can use the board to track progress
by updating the status of those items.
To gain insight into a portfolio of features, scenarios, or user experiences, product
owners and program managers map user stories to features. When a team works in
sprints, they define tasks that automatically link to user stories. If you're new to the Agile
process, review the section Plan and track work with Agile to get started.
From the web portal or Microsoft Test Manager, testers can create and run test cases
against bugs and issues, which are used to track code defects and blocking issues.
Product owners typically define and stack rank user stories, which describe the work
involved for developing applications, requirements, and elements. The team then
estimates the effort and work to deliver the highest priority items.
Create user stories from the quick add panel on the product backlog page. From that
page, you can also drag-and-drop items to reorder them or map them to features.
Define user stories


# Page 87

You can open each user story to provide more details and estimate the story points.
Define Story Points so your team can use the forecast feature and velocity charts to
estimate future sprints or work efforts. By prioritizing the user stories on the backlog
page (that's captured in the Stack Rank field), product owners can indicate which items
should be given higher priority.
Use the guidance in the following table and the common fields used across work item
types when you complete the form.
Field/tab
Usage
Description
For user stories, provide enough detail for estimating how much work is required to
implement the story. Focus on who the feature is for, what users want to accomplish,
and why. Don't describe how the feature should be developed. Do provide sufficient
details so that your team can write tasks and test cases to implement the item.
Acceptance Criteria
Provide the criteria to be met before the bug or user story can be closed. Before work
begins, describe the customer acceptance criteria as clearly as possible. Conversations
between the team and customers to define the acceptance criteria help ensure that your
team understands your customers' expectations. You can use the acceptance criteria as


# Page 88

the basis for acceptance tests to more effectively evaluate whether an item is
satisfactorily completed.
Value Area
The area of customer value addressed by the epic, feature, requirement, or backlog
item. Values include:
Architectural: Technical services to implement business features that deliver
solution
Business: Services that fulfill customers or stakeholder needs that directly deliver
customer value to support the business (Default)
Story Points
Estimate the amount of work required to complete a user story using any numeric unit
of measurement your team prefers.
Agile velocity charts and forecast tools reference the values in this field. For more
information, see the Estimating white paper.
Priority
A subjective rating of the user story, feature, or requirement as it relates to the business.
Allowed values are:
1: Product can't ship without the feature.
2: Product can't ship without the feature, but it doesn't have to be addressed
immediately.
3: Implementation of the feature is optional, based on resources, time, and risk.
Risk
A subjective rating of the relative uncertainty around the successful completion of a user
story. Allowed values are:
1 - High
2 - Medium
3 - Low
Use the Discussion section to add and review comments made about the work being
performed.
Capture comments in the Discussion section


# Page 89

The rich text editor toolbar appears under the text entry area when you place your
cursor in any text box that supports text formatting.
Select one of the following icons to open a menu of recent entries where you
mentioned someone, linked to a work item, or linked to a pull request. Alternatively, you
can open the same menu by entering @ , # , or ! .
７ Note
A Discussion work item field doesn't exist. To query work items with comments
from the Discussion area, filter on the History field. The full content of the text
entered in the Discussion text box is added to the History field.
Mention someone, a group, work item, or pull request


# Page 90

Enter a name or number to filter the menu list to match your entry. Select the entry you
want to add. To bring a group into the discussion, enter @  followed by the group name,
such as a team or security group.
To edit or delete any of your discussion comments, choose 
 Edit or choose the 
actions icon and then choose Delete.
After you update the comment, select Update. To delete the comment, confirm that you
want to delete it. The History tab on the work item form maintains a full audit trail of all
edited and deleted comments.
Add one or more reactions to a comment by choosing a smiley icon at the upper-right
corner of any comment. Choose from the icons at the bottom of a comment next to any
existing reactions. To remove your reaction, choose the reaction on the bottom of your
comment. The following image shows an example of the experience of adding a
reaction, and the display of reactions on a comment.
Edit or delete a comment
Add a reaction to a comment


# Page 91

If you only have permissions to add to the Discussion of a work item, then you can do
so by saving comments. This permission is controlled by Area Path nodes and the Edit
work item comments in this node permission. For more information, see Set work
tracking permissions, Create child nodes, modify work items under an area or iteration
path.
When you save the comments, you don't need to save the work item.
As work progresses, you change the State field to update the status. Optionally, you can
specify a reason. The state and reason fields appear on the work item form in the header
area.
Save a comment without saving the work item
７ Note
This feature is available starting in Azure DevOps Server 2022.1.
７ Note
When you save changes made to the Discussion control, only the comment gets
saved. No work item rules defined for the work item type are executed.
Track progress


# Page 92

When you update the workflow, teams know which items are new, in progress, or
completed. Most WITs support transition both forward and backward from each
workflow state. These diagrams show the main progression and regression states of the
user story, bug, and task WITs.
User Story
Bug
Task
A typical workflow progression for a user story follows:
The product owner creates a user story in the New state with the default reason,
New user story.
The team updates the status to Active when they decide to complete the work
during the sprint.
A user story gets moved to Resolved when the team has completed all its
associated tasks and unit tests for the story pass.
A user story gets moved to the Closed state when the product owner agrees that
the story has been implemented according to the Acceptance Criteria and
acceptance tests pass.
Agile workflow states
ﾉ
Expand table
Update status with board or Taskboards


# Page 93

Teams can use the board to update the status of requirements, and the Taskboard to
update the status of tasks. Dragging items to a new state column updates both the State
and Reason fields.
You can customize the board to support more swimlanes or columns. For more
information, see Customize your work tracking experience.
When you manage a suite of products or user experiences, you might want to view the
scope and progress of work across the product portfolio. You can view the scope and
progress of work by defining features and mapping user stories to features.
Using portfolio backlogs, you can drill down from one backlog to another to view the
level of detail you want. Also, use portfolio backlogs to view a rollup of work in progress
across several teams when you setup a hierarchy of teams.
When your team manages their work in sprints, they can use the sprint backlog page to
break down the work to be accomplished into distinct tasks.
Name the task and estimate the work it takes.
Map user stories to features
Define tasks


# Page 94

When you use the Agile process, teams forecast work and define tasks at the start of
each sprint. Each team member then performs a subset of those tasks. Tasks can include
development, testing, and other kinds of work. For example, a developer defines tasks to
implement user stories, and a tester defines tasks to write and run test cases.
When teams estimate work using hours or days, they define tasks and the Remaining
Work and Activity (optional) fields.
Field/tab
Usage
Original Estimate
The amount of estimated work required to complete a task. Typically, this field doesn't
change after it's assigned. You can specify work in hours or in days. There are no
inherent time units associated with this field.
Remaining Work
The amount of work remaining to complete a task. As work progresses, update this field.
This field is used to calculate capacity charts, the sprint burndown chart, and the
following SQL Server reports: Burndown and Burn Rate, Remaining Work, and Status on
All Iterations. If you divide a task into subtasks, specify hours for the subtasks only. You
can specify work in any unit of measurement your team chooses.


# Page 95

Completed Work
The amount of work spent implementing a task.
Activity
Select the type of activity this task represents when your team estimates sprint capacity
by activity.
Integrated in Build
Product build number that incorporates the code or fixes a bug.
Track testing progress with user stories and code defects.
From the web portal or Test Manager, you can create test cases that automatically link
to a user story or bug. Or, you can link a user story to a test case from the 
 Links tab.
The test case contains multiple fields, many of which are automated and integrated with
Test Manager and the build process. For a description of each field, see Query based on
build and test integration fields.
Track test progress
Test user stories


# Page 96

The 
 (links tab) captures the links to user stories and bugs in a test case. By linking
user stories and bugs to test cases, the team can track the progress made in testing
each item. By defining these links, you support information that appears in the Stories
Overview Report report.
You can create bugs from the web portal, Visual Studio, or when testing with Test
Manager.
The following fields and tabs appear in most work items. Each tab gets used to track
specific information, such as 
 History, 
 Links, or 
 Attachments. These three
tabs provide a history of changes, view of linked work items, and ability to view and
attach files.
The only required field for all work item types is Title. When you save a work item, the
system assigns it a unique ID. The form highlights required field in yellow. For
information about other fields, see Work item field index.
Track code defects
Definitions for common work tracking fields
７ Note
Additional fields may be required depending on customizations made to your
process and project.


# Page 97

Field/tab
Usage
Title
Enter a description of 255 characters or less. You can always modify the title later.
Assigned To
Assign the work item to the team member responsible for performing the work.
State
When the work item is created, the State defaults to the first state in the workflow. As
work progresses, update it to reflect the current state.
Reason
Use the default first. Update it when you change state. Each State is associated with a
default reason.
Area
Choose the area path associated with the product or team, or leave blank until assigned
during a planning meeting. To change the dropdown list of areas, see Define area paths
and assign to a team.
Iteration
Choose the sprint or iteration in which the work is to be completed, or leave it blank and
assign it later, during a planning meeting. To change the drop-down list of iterations,
see Define iteration paths (sprints) and configure team iterations.
(History)
Review the audit trail that the system captures and capture additional information.
Every time that the work item is updated, information is appended to the history.
History includes the date of the change, who made the change, and which fields were
changed. You can also add formatted text to the history field.


# Page 98

 (Links)
Add all types of links, such as hyperlinks, changesets, source files, and so on.
This tab also lists all links defined for the work item.
(Attachments)
Share more detailed information by adding files to the work item, such as email threads,
documents, images, log files, or other file types.
For most work item types, you can add fields, change the workflow, add custom rules,
and add custom pages to the work item form. You can also add custom work item types.

Manage Scrum process template objects
Article • 03/25/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
The Scrum process supports the following work item types (WITs) to plan and track
work, tests, feedback, and code review. With different WITs you can track different types
of work—such as product backlog items, tasks, bugs, and more. These objects get
created when you create a project using the Scrum process. They're based on Scrum
principles and values
.
Along with the WITs, teams have access to a set of work item queries to track
information, analyze progress, and make decisions.
You build your project plan by creating a backlog of work items that represent the
features, requirements, user stories, or other work to do. You track bugs, tasks, and

management, teams create features and epics to view a rollup of their product backlog
items within or across teams. For more information, see Scrum process work item types

７ Note
A work item is a database record that contains the definition, assignment, priority,
and state of work. Work item types define the template of fields, workflow, and
form for each type. Work items can be linked to each other to support tracking
dependencies, roll up of work, and reports.
List work items

You can view and run queries from the web portal or from the Team Explorer plug-in to
Visual Studio. You can also modify a query using the query editor to apply different filter
criteria and add queries to team dashboards.
Manage work more effectively with the following tips:
Find work items assigned to you by adding @Me as the value for the Assigned To
field in one of the query clauses.
Modify any query by adding criteria to focus on a product area, an iteration, or
another field. To modify a query, open the query editor.
Open any query in Excel where you can update the fields of one or more work
items and publish your changes to the database for tracking work items.
Visualize status or progress by creating a pie-chart, column chart, or trend chart for
flat-list queries.
All valid users with standard access can create queries and folders under the My
Queries area. To create queries and query folders under Shared Queries, you must
have the Contribute permission set and have been assigned Basic access or
greater. For more information, see Set permissions on queries.
７ Note
When you create a new project, there's no longer a default set of Shared Queries.
The definitions for Shared Queries were removed from the process template. For
on-premises deployments, you can add them to a custom process template as
described in Add work item queries to a process template.
Tips for shared queries

All processes—Agile, Scrum, and CMMI—support building status and trend charts and
dashboards. Also, several charts are automatically built based on the Agile tools you use.
These charts display within the web portal.
You can define a shared flat query and create a chart based on your tracking interests.

Manage Scrum process work item types
& workflow
Article • 06/08/2023
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
To plan a software project and track software defects using Scrum, teams use the
product backlog item (PBI) and bug work item types (WITs). To gain insight into a
portfolio of features, scenarios, or user experiences, product owners, and program
managers can map PBIs and bugs to features. When teams work in sprints, they define
tasks that automatically link to PBIs and bugs.
Testers can create and run test cases and create bugs to track code defects using the
web portal or Microsoft Test Manager. Impediments track blocking issues.
When you define a product backlog item, focus on the value that your customers gain
and avoid descriptions of how your team develops the feature. The product owner can
prioritize your product backlog based on each item's business value, effort, and relative
dependency on other backlog items. As your business requirements evolve, so does
your product backlog. Typically, teams specify details only for the highest priority items,
or those items assigned to the current and next sprint.
７ Note
If you're new to the Scrum process, review About Sprints, Scrum and project
management.
Define PBIs and bugs


# Page 106

You can create PBIs and bugs from the quick add panel on the product backlog page.
Afterward, you can open each PBI or bug to provide more details and estimate the
effort. Also, by prioritizing the PBIs and bugs on the backlog page (which is captured in
the Backlog Priority field), product owners can indicate which items should be given
higher priority.
When you define the Effort for PBIs and bugs, you can use the forecast feature and
velocity charts to estimate future sprints or work efforts. When you define the Business
Value, product owners can specify priorities separate from the changeable backlog stack
ranking.
Use the following fields and fields used in common across work item types when you
complete the work item form. For more information, see Manage bugs.
Field/tab
Usage


# Page 107

Effort
Estimate the amount of work required to complete a PBI using any unit of measurement
your team prefers, such as story points or time. A numeric value is required.
Agile velocity charts and forecast tools reference the values in this field. For more
information, see the Estimating white paper.
Business Value
Specify a number that captures the relative value of a PBI compared to other PBIs. The
higher the number, the greater the business value.
Description
Provide enough detail for estimating how much work is required to implement the item.
Focus on who the feature is for, what users want to accomplish, and why. Don't describe
how the feature should be developed. Do provide sufficient details so that your team
can write tasks and test cases to implement the item.
Acceptance Criteria
Define what "Done" means by describing the criteria that the team should use to verify
whether the PBI or the bug fix has been fully implemented.
Before work begins on a PBI or bug, describe the criteria for customer acceptance as
clearly as possible. Conversations between the team and customers to determine the
acceptance criteria helps ensure a common understanding within the team to meet
customers' expectations. The acceptance criteria can be used as the basis for acceptance
tests so that the team can more effectively evaluate whether an item has been
satisfactorily completed.
Use the Discussion section to add and review comments made about the work being
performed.
Capture comments in the Discussion section


# Page 108

The rich text editor toolbar appears under the text entry area when you place your
cursor in any text box that supports text formatting.
Select one of the following icons to open a menu of recent entries where you
mentioned someone, linked to a work item, or linked to a pull request. Alternatively, you
can open the same menu by entering @ , # , or ! .
７ Note
A Discussion work item field doesn't exist. To query work items with comments
from the Discussion area, filter on the History field. The full content of the text
entered in the Discussion text box is added to the History field.
Mention someone, a group, work item, or pull request


# Page 109

Enter a name or number to filter the menu list to match your entry. Select the entry you
want to add. To bring a group into the discussion, enter @  followed by the group name,
such as a team or security group.
To edit or delete any of your discussion comments, choose 
 Edit or choose the 
actions icon and then choose Delete.
After you update the comment, select Update. To delete the comment, confirm that you
want to delete it. The History tab on the work item form maintains a full audit trail of all
edited and deleted comments.
Add one or more reactions to a comment by choosing a smiley icon at the upper-right
corner of any comment. Choose from the icons at the bottom of a comment next to any
existing reactions. To remove your reaction, choose the reaction on the bottom of your
comment. The following image shows an example of the experience of adding a
reaction, and the display of reactions on a comment.
Edit or delete a comment
Add a reaction to a comment


# Page 110

If you only have permissions to add to the Discussion of a work item, then you can do
so by saving comments. This permission is controlled by Area Path nodes and the Edit
work item comments in this node permission. For more information, see Set work
tracking permissions, Create child nodes, modify work items under an area or iteration
path.
When you save the comments, you don't need to save the work item.
As work progresses, you change the State field to update the status. Optionally, you can
specify a reason. The state and reason fields appear on the work item form in the header
area.
Save a comment without saving the work item
７ Note
This feature is available starting in Azure DevOps Server 2022.1.
７ Note
When you save changes made to the Discussion control, only the comment gets
saved. No work item rules defined for the work item type are executed.
Track progress


# Page 111

When you update the State, teams know which items are new, in progress, or
completed. Most WITs support transition both forward and backward from each
workflow state. These diagrams show the main progression and regression states of the
PBI, bug, and task WITs.
Product Backlog Item
Bug
Task
PBIs and bugs follow this typical workflow progression:
The product owner creates a PBI or a tester creates a bug in the New state with the
default reason, New backlog item
The product owner moves the item to Approved after it's sufficiently described
and ready for the team to estimate the level of effort. Most of the time, items near
the top of the Product Backlog are in the Approved state, while items toward the
middle and bottom are in a New state
The team updates the status to Committed when they decide to commit to
working on it during the sprint
Scrum workflow states
ﾉ
Expand table


# Page 112

The item gets moved to the Done state when the team has completed all its
associated tasks and the product owner agrees that it has been implemented
according to the Acceptance Criteria.
Teams can use the board to update the status of PBIs, and the sprint Taskboard to
update the status of tasks. Dragging items to a new state column updates both the State
and Reason fields.
You can customize the board to support more swim lanes or columns. For other
customization options, see Customize your work tracking experience.
When you manage a suite of products or user experiences, you might want to view the
scope and progress of work across the product portfolio. To do so, define features and
map PBIs to features.
Using portfolio backlogs, you can drill down from one backlog to another to view the
level of detail you want. Also, you can use portfolio backlogs to view a rollup of work in
progress across several teams when you setup a hierarchy of teams.
When your team manages their work in sprints, they can use the sprint backlog page to
break down the work to be accomplished into distinct tasks.
Update status with board or Taskboards
Map PBIs to features
Define tasks


# Page 113

Name the task and estimate the work it takes.
Teams can forecast work and define tasks at the start of each sprint, and each team
member completes a subset of those tasks. Tasks can include development, testing, and


# Page 114

other kinds of work. For example, a developer can define tasks to implement PBIs, and a
tester can define tasks to write and run test cases.
When teams estimate work using hours or days, they define tasks and the Remaining
Work and Activity (optional) fields.
Field/tab
Usage
Remaining Work
Indicate how many hours or days of work remain to complete a task. As work
progresses, update this field. It's used to calculate capacity charts, the sprint burndown
chart, and the Sprint Burndown (Scrum) report.
If you divide a task into subtasks, specify Remaining Work for the subtasks only. You can
specify work in any unit of measurement your team chooses.
Activity
Select the type of activity this task represents when your team estimates sprint capacity
by activity.
From the web portal or Test Manager, you can create test cases that automatically link
to a PBI or bug. Or, you can link a PBI or bug to a test case from the 
 (links tab).
The test case contains many fields, many of which are automated and integrated with
Test Manager and the build process. For a description of each field, see Query based on
Track test progress
Test PBIs


# Page 115

build and test integration fields.
The 
 (links tab) captures the links to all the PBIs and bugs in a test case. By linking
PBIs and bugs to test cases, the team can track the progress made in testing each item.
You can create bugs from the web portal web portal, Visual Studio, or when testing with
Test Manager.
The following fields and tabs appear in most work items. Each tab gets used to track
specific information, such as 
 History, 
 Links, or 
 Attachments. These three
Track code defects
Definitions for common work tracking fields


# Page 116

tabs provide a history of changes, view of linked work items, and ability to view and
attach files.
The only required field for all work item types is Title. When you save a work item, the
system assigns it a unique ID. The form highlights required field in yellow. For
information about other fields, see Work item field index.
Field/tab
Usage
Title
Enter a description of 255 characters or less. You can always modify the title later.
Assigned To
Assign the work item to the team member responsible for performing the work.
State
When the work item is created, the State defaults to the first state in the workflow. As
work progresses, update it to reflect the current state.
Reason
Use the default first. Update it when you change state. Each State is associated with a
default reason.
Area
Choose the area path associated with the product or team, or leave blank until assigned
during a planning meeting. To change the dropdown list of areas, see Define area paths
and assign to a team.
７ Note
Additional fields may be required depending on customizations made to your
process and project.


# Page 117

Iteration
Choose the sprint or iteration in which the work is to be completed, or leave it blank and
assign it later, during a planning meeting. To change the drop-down list of iterations,
see Define iteration paths (sprints) and configure team iterations.
(History)
Review the audit trail that the system captures and capture additional information.
Every time that the work item is updated, information is appended to the history.
History includes the date of the change, who made the change, and which fields were
changed. You can also add formatted text to the history field.
 (Links)
Add all types of links, such as hyperlinks, changesets, source files, and so on.
This tab also lists all links defined for the work item.
(Attachments)
Share more detailed information by adding files to the work item, such as email threads,
documents, images, log files, or other file types.
For most work item types, you can add fields, change the workflow, add custom rules,
and add custom pages to the work item form. You can also add custom work item types.
For more information, see Customize an inheritance process.
Use the Impediment work item type to track events that may block progress or ship a
PBI. Use the Bug work item type exclusively to track code defects.
You can add an impediment from the New work item widget added to a team
dashboard, or from the New menu on the Queries page.

The Backlog Priority field is used to track the relative ranking of PBIs, bugs, features, or
epics. However, by default it doesn't appear on the work item form. The sequence of
items on the backlog page is determined according to where you've added the items or
moved the items on the page. As you drag items, a background process updates this
field.

Understand CMMI process template
artifacts
Article • 09/10/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
The Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) process supports various work item
types (WITs) to plan and track work, tests, feedback, and code reviews. Different WITs
allow you to track various types of work, such as requirements, change requests, tasks,
bugs, and more. These artifacts get created when you set up a project using the CMMI
process, based on the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) framework.
Teams can use a set of work item queries to track information, analyze progress, and
make decisions.
７ Note
You can customize the work tracking system for your project by creating and
customizing an inherited process and applying that process to your project.
For more information, see Inheritance process model.


# Page 120

Teams plan their project by capturing features and requirements. When teams work in
sprints, they define tasks and link them to requirements. To gain insight into a rollup of
requirements across teams, program managers link requirements to a feature. Blocking
issues are tracked using issues. For details on using these WITs, see CMMI process work
item types and workflow
The following image shows the essential flow for getting started. For more information,
see Get started with Agile tools to plan and track work.
Select one of the following images to go to the linked article.
You can also customize a process template. For more information, see About
processes and process templates.
Plan and track work with CMMI
７ Note
A work item is a database record that contains the definition, assignment, priority,
and state of work. Work item types define the template of fields, workflow, and
form for each type. Work items can be linked to each other to support tracking
dependencies, roll up of work, and reports.


# Page 121

You can use work item queries to list work items based on their type, such as change
requests, bugs, tasks, and requirements.
View and run queries from the web portal or from the Team Explorer plug-in for Visual
Studio. Modify a query using the query editor to apply different filter criteria and add
queries to team dashboards.
Enhance your workflow using the following tips:
Add @Me as the value for the Assigned To field in a query clause to find work
items assigned to you.
Open the query editor to modify any query by adding criteria for a product area,
iteration, or another field.
Open a query in Excel to update fields of one or more work items and publish
changes to the database.
Create a pie-chart, column chart, or trend chart to visualize status or progress for
flat-list queries.
Create queries and folders under the My Queries area with standard access. To
create queries and folders under Shared Queries, ensure you have the Contribute
permission and Basic access or greater. For more information, see Set permissions
on queries.
All processes—Agile, Scrum, and CMMI—support building status and trend charts and
dashboards. Also, several charts are automatically built based on the Agile tools you use.
These charts display within the web portal.
List work items with queries
７ Note
When you create a new project, there's no longer a default set of Shared Queries.
The definitions for Shared Queries were removed from the process template. For
on-premises deployments, you can add them to a custom process template as
described in Add work item queries to a process template.
Tips for shared queries

You can define a shared flat query and create a chart based on your tracking interests.
Chart types include status—pie, bar, column, stacked bar, and pivot—and trend—
stacked area, line, and area—charts.
The Analytics Service can answer quantitative questions about the past or present state
of your projects. You can add Analytics widgets to a dashboard or use Power BI to create

CMMI process work item types and
workflow in Azure Boards
Article • 10/03/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Teams use the work item types (WITs) provided with the MSF for CMMI Process
Improvement 2015 (CMMI) process to plan and track progress of software projects.
Teams define requirements to manage the backlog of work and then, using your board,
track progress by updating the status of requirements.
To gain insight into a portfolio of requirements, product owners can map requirements
to features. When teams work in iterations, they define tasks that automatically link to
requirements.
Using Microsoft Test Manager and the web portal, testers create and run test cases and
define bugs to track code defects.
To support other CMMI processes, teams can track change requests, risks, issues, and
notes captured in review meetings. If you're new to the CMMI process, review the
section Plan and track work with CMMI to get started.
Create requirements from the quick add panel on the product backlog page. Later, you
can open each requirement to provide more details and estimate its size.
Define requirements


# Page 125

Or, you can bulk add requirements using a cvs file.
） Important
Microsoft Project Integration and the TFSFieldMapping  command aren't supported
for:
Visual Studio 2019 and Azure DevOps Office Integration 2019.
Azure DevOps Server 2019 and later versions, including Azure DevOps
Services.
Full support for Microsoft Excel integration is maintained, allowing bulk import and
update of work items. Alternatives to using Microsoft Project include:
Delivery Plans
Marketplace extensions like Project Connect
 or GANTT chart


# Page 126

Requirements specify the functions and product elements that teams need to create.
Product owners typically define and stack rank requirements on the product backlog
page. The team then scopes the size of the effort to deliver the highest priority items.
Use the following guidance and that provided for fields used in common across work
item types when filling out the form. For more information, see Plan a project.
Field
Usage
Description
Provide enough detail for estimating how much work will be required to implement the
requirement. Focus on who the requirement is for, what users want to accomplish, and
why. Don't describe how the requirement should be developed. Do provide sufficient
details so that your team can write tasks and test cases to implement the item.
In HTML fields, you can add rich text and images.
Impact Assessment
The customer impact of not implementing this requirement. You might include details
from the Kano model about whether this requirement is in the surprise, required, or
obvious categories. You capture this information in the rich-text HTML field that
corresponds to Impact Assessment.

Task
The typical workflow progression for a requirement is:
The product owner creates a requirement in the Proposed state with the default
reason, New requirement.
The product owner updates the status to Active when they begin work to
implement it.
The team updates the status to Resolved when code development is finished and
system tests have passed.
Lastly, the team or product owner moves the requirement to Closed when the
product owner agrees that it has been implemented according to the Acceptance
Criteria and passed all validation tests.
Teams can use the board to update the status of requirements, and the sprint taskboard
to update the status of tasks. Dragging items to a new state column updates both the
CMMI workflow states

# Page 134

When teams estimate work, they define tasks and estimate the hours or days to
complete tasks. Teams forecast work and define tasks at the start of an iteration, and
each team member does a subset of those tasks. Tasks can include development,
testing, and other kinds of work. For example, a developer can define tasks to
implement requirements, and a tester can define tasks to write and run test cases. By
linking tasks to requirements and bugs, they see the progress made on these items. For
more information, see Iteration activities.

the product. Issues differ from risks in that teams identify issues spontaneously,
generally during daily team meetings.
Risk to track the probability and degree of variance between actual and desired
outcomes. When you manage risks, you strategically minimize the variance
between the outcome that you want and the actual outcome.
Review to document the results of a design or code review. Team members can
capture the details of how the design or code meets standards in areas of name
correctness, code relevance, extensibility, code complexity, algorithmic complexity,
and code security.
You can add an issue from the New work item widget added to a team dashboard,
or from the New menu on the Queries page.
Work items you add from the widget are automatically scoped to your team's default
area and iteration paths. To change the team context, see Switch team context.

Definitions for common work tracking fields


# Page 138

The following fields and tabs appear in most work items. Each tab gets used to track
specific information, such as 
 History, 
 Links, or 
 Attachments. These three
tabs provide a history of changes, view of linked work items, and ability to view and
attach files.
The only required field for all work item types is Title. When you save a work item, the
system assigns it a unique ID. The form highlights required field in yellow. For
information about other fields, see Work item field index.
Field/tab
Usage
Title
Enter a description of 255 characters or less. You can always modify the title later.
Assigned To
Assign the work item to the team member responsible for performing the work.
State
When the work item is created, the State defaults to the first state in the workflow. As
work progresses, update it to reflect the current state.
Reason
Use the default first. Update it when you change state. Each State is associated with a
default reason.
Area
Choose the area path associated with the product or team, or leave blank until assigned
during a planning meeting. To change the dropdown list of areas, see Define area paths

and assign to a team.
Iteration
Choose the sprint or iteration in which the work is to be completed, or leave it blank and
assign it later, during a planning meeting. To change the drop-down list of iterations,
see Define iteration paths (sprints) and configure team iterations.
(History)
Review the audit trail that the system captures and capture additional information.
Every time that the work item is updated, information is appended to the history.
History includes the date of the change, who made the change, and which fields were
changed. You can also add formatted text to the history field.
 (Links)
Add all types of links, such as hyperlinks, changesets, source files, and so on.
This tab also lists all links defined for the work item.
(Attachments)
Share more detailed information by adding files to the work item, such as email threads,
documents, images, log files, or other file types.
For most work item types, you can add fields, change the workflow, add custom rules,
and add custom pages to the work item form. You can also add custom work item types.

Background to Capability Maturity
Model Integration (CMMI)
Article • 02/24/2023
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019 | TFS
2018
The definitive guide to the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) for
Development is published by the Software Engineering Institute as "CMMI: Guidelines
for Process Integration and Product Improvement." This book specifically describes the
CMMI for Development (CMMI-DEV) version 1.3, which is one of the models within the
CMMI product suite. You may also find "CMMI Distilled: A Practical Introduction to
Integrated Process Improvement" to be a useful and accessible book about CMMI.
The CMMI began in 1987 as the Capability Maturity Model (CMM), a project at the
Software Engineering Institute (SEI). SEI is a research center at Carnegie-Mellon
University, which was established and funded by the United States Department of
Defense. First published in 1991, the CMM for Software began as a checklist of critical
success factors. The model also built upon research at International Business Machines
(IBM) Corporation and 20th-century quality assurance leaders such as Philip Crosby and
W. Edwards Deming. Both the name, Capability Maturity Model, and the Staged
Representation five levels were inspired by Crosby's Manufacturing Maturity Model.
Applied mainly to defense programs, CMM achieved considerable adoption and
underwent several revisions. Its success led to the development of CMMs for a variety of
subjects beyond software. The proliferation of new models was confusing. In response,
the government funded a two-year project to create a single, extensible framework that
integrated systems engineering, software engineering, and product development. This
effort involved more than 200 industry and academic experts. The result was CMMI.
CMMI-DEV is a model. It isn't a process, nor a prescription to be followed. Instead,
CMMI-DEV provides a set of organizational behaviors that have proven to be of use in

The guidance provided here is based on version 1.3 for CMMI and supports the
CMMI process available with Azure DevOps. No plans exist at this time to update

software development and systems engineering. Why use such a model? What is its
purpose? And how best should it be used? These critical questions are perhaps the most
misunderstood issues with CMMI.
Improvement efforts require a model of how your organization works, which functions
they need, and how those functions interact. A model gives you an understanding of
organizational elements and assists in discussions of how and what can and should be
improved.
A model offers the following benefits:
Provides a common framework and language to help communicate
Leverages years of experience
Helps users consider the large picture while focusing on improvement
Is often supported by trainers and consultants
Can help solve disagreements by providing agreed-upon standards
The purpose of the CMMI model is to assess the maturity of an organization's processes
and to provide guidance on improving processes, with a goal of improved products.
Also, CMMI is a model for risk management and provide a way to measure an
organization's ability to manage risk. The ability to manage risk factors factors into an
organizations ability to deliver high-quality products. Another perspective on managing
risk is how well an organization performs under stress. A high maturity, high capability
organization can easily respond to unexpected, stressful events. A low maturity and
lower capability organization tends to panic under stress, blindly follow obviated
procedures, or throw out all process altogether and retrench back to chaos.
The CMMI, however, isn't a proven indicator of the economic performance of an
organization. Although higher maturity organizations may manage risk better and be
more predictable, evidence exists that higher maturity firms tend to be risk-averse. Risk
aversion can lead to a lack of innovation or evidence of greater bureaucracy that results
in long lead times and a lack of competitiveness. Lower maturity firms tend to be more
innovative and creative but chaotic and unpredictable. When results are achieved, they
are often the result of heroic effort by individuals or managers.

What's the best way to use the CMMI model?

The model was designed to be used as the basis for a process improvement initiative,
with its use in assessment only a support system for measuring improvement. There has
been mixed success with this usage. It is all too easy to mistake the model for a process
definition and try to follow it, instead of a map that identifies gaps in existing processes
that may need to be filled. The fundamental building block of CMMI is a process area
that defines goals and several activities that are often used to meet them. One example
of a process area is Process and Product Quality Assurance. Another is Configuration
Management. It is important to understand that a process area is not a process. A single
process may cross multiple process areas, and an individual process area may involve
multiple processes.
The CMMI-DEV is really two models that share the same underlying elements. The first
and most familiar is the Staged Representation, which presents the 22 process areas
mapped into one of five organizational maturity levels. An appraisal of an organization
would assess the level at which it was operating, and this level would be an indicator of
its ability to manage risk and, as, deliver on its promises.
Levels 4 and 5 are often referred to as higher maturity levels. There is often a clear
difference between higher maturity organizations, which demonstrate the quantitative
management and optimizing behaviors, and lower maturity organizations, which are
merely managed or following defined processes. Higher maturity organizations show
lower variability in processes and often use leading indicators as part of a statistically
defensible management method. As a result, higher maturity organizations tend to be
both more predictable and faster at responding to new information, assuming that
other bureaucracy doesn't get in the way. Where low maturity organizations tend to
demonstrate heroic effort, high maturity organizations may blindly follow processes
when under stress and fail to recognize that a process change may be a more
appropriate response.
The Continuous Representation models process capability within each of the 22 process
areas individually, which allows the organization to tailor their improvement efforts to
the processes that offer the highest business value. This representation is more in line
with Crosby's original model. Appraisals against this model result in profiles of capability


# Page 144

rather than a single number. Because the organizational maturity level is the level that
most managers and executives understand, there are ways of mapping the results of a
continuous model assessment into the five stages.
Using the staged model as a basis for a process improvement program can be
dangerous when implementers forget that the CMMI isn't a process nor a workflow
model. Instead, the CMMI is designed to provide goals for process and workflow to
achieve. Meeting such goals improves the maturity of the organization and the
likelihood that events unfold as planned. Perhaps the biggest failure mode is making
achieving a level the goal and then creating processes and infrastructure simply to pass
the appraisal. The goal of any process improvement activity should be measurable
improvement, not a number.
The Continuous model has enjoyed success as a guide to process improvement. Some
consulting firms choose only to offer guidance around the Continuous model. The most
obvious difference is that a process improvement program that is designed around the
Continuous model doesn't have artificial goals that are determined by maturity levels.
The Continuous model also lends itself to applying process improvement in areas where
it is most likely to leverage an economic benefit for the organization. Therefore, those
who follow the Continuous model are more likely to receive positive feedback from an
initiative that is based on the CMMI model. Moreover, positive feedback is more likely to
lead to the development of a virtuous cycle of improvements.

In the Staged Representation, the process areas are mapped against each stage, as
shown in the following illustration.


# Page 146

In the Continuous Representation, the process areas are mapped into functional
groupings, as shown in the following illustration.
Each process area is made up of required, expected, and informative components. Only
the required components are actually required to satisfy an appraisal against the model.
The required components are the specific and generic goals for each process area. The
expected components are the specific and generic practices for each specific or generic
goal. Note that, because an expected component is merely expected and not required,
this indicates that a specific or generic practice can be replaced by an equivalent
practice. The expected practices are there to guide implementers and appraisers. If an
alternative practice is chosen, it's up to the implementer to advise an appraiser and
justify why an alternative practice is appropriate. Informative components provide
details that help implementers get started with a process improvement initiative that is
guided by the CMMI model. Informative components include subpractices of generic
and specific practices and typical work products.
Only generic and specific goals are required. Everything else is provided as a guide. For
examples of expected and informative components, the CMMI literature pulled data
from large space and defense-systems projects. These projects might not reflect the
type of projects that are undertaken in your organization, nor may they reflect more
recent trends in the industry, such as the emergence of Agile software development
methods.

Default permissions and access levels
for Azure Boards
Article • 06/27/2023
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
As a member of an Azure Boards project, you can use most features to track work.
Limitations to select features are based on the access level and security group to which a
user is assigned. The Basic access level and higher supports full access to all Azure
Boards features. Stakeholder access level provides partial support to select features,
allowing users to view and modify work items, but not use all features. The built-in
security groups—Readers, Contributors, and Project Administrators—and team
administrator role grant permissions to specific features.
In the tables provided in this article, a ✔️ indicates that the corresponding access level
or security group has access to a feature by default.
For a comparison chart of Stakeholder versus Basic access, see the Feature matrix
. To
assign or change an access level, see Add users and assign licenses. If you need to grant
specific users select permissions, you can do so.
You can use work items to track anything you need to track. For more information, see
Understand how work items are used to track issues, tasks, and epics.

Stakeholder access supports business owners. It also supports analysts and other team
members who don't manage the work of a project, but need to view and add ideas to
the backlog, add context and information to work items, and review status and progress.
All members of an organization who don't use Visual Studio but want to contribute to
work item tracking and monitor progress can be assigned as a stakeholder. Note, even if
you change the permission level for a user assigned Stakeholder access, the user is
blocked from accessing the feature.

To manage work tracking effectively, assign specific permissions to users or groups for
particular objects, projects, or collections. You can also define custom rules for processes
or projects that apply to specific users or groups, controlling their actions accordingly.
For most features, we recommend adding users to the project's Contributors group,
which grants comprehensive access and ensures a seamless and efficient work tracking
experience.
Permissions: To set work tracking permissions, be a member of the Project
Administrators group or have explicit permissions to manage the work tracking area as
described in this article.
The following table summarizes the different permissions you can set at the object,
project, or collection level. The team administrator role provides access to add and
modify team resources. Also, see Default permissions for Boards, Backlogs, Sprints,
Delivery Plans, Test Management, and Queries, further in this article.

Area path permissions let you manage access to edit or modify work items, test cases, or
test plans assigned to those areas. You can restrict access to users or groups. You can
also set permissions for who can add or modify areas or iterations for the project.
Do the following steps to define both areas and iterations for a project.
1. Choose Project settings > Project configuration > Boards, and then select Areas
or Iterations to modify Area Paths or Iteration Paths.
Create child nodes, modify work items under
an area or iteration path
７ Note
Project members with permissions to create or edit Area Paths or Iteration Paths
can't set team Area Paths and Iteration Paths. To configure team settings, be
added to the team administrator role or be a member of the Project
Administrators group.

Custom rules don't control permissions, but they affect whether a user can modify a
work item or set the value of a work item field. Azure Boards supports the following
work tracking customizations that support business workflows.
７ Note
Work items are subject to rules applied to them. Conditional rules based on user or
group membership are cached for your web browser. If you find yourself restricted
to update a work item, you may have encountered one of these rules. If you believe
you've encountered an issue that doesn't apply to you, see Work item form
IndexDB caching issues. For more information, see Rules and rule evaluation.
Use custom rules


# Page 166

Customization
Examples
Apply rules upon work item creation,
state change, and specified state.
- Make a field read-only
- Make a field required
Apply rules when a field value is empty,
set to a specific value, or change or not
changed to a value.
- Clear the value of a field if it's empty or meets
certain criteria
- Set a predefined value for the field if it's empty or
meets specific conditions
- Copy the value of one field to another field
- Hide a field based on certain conditions or values
Apply rules that dictate what state a
work item can get moved to from a
given state.
- Reassign a work item based on state changes
- Specify that a work item can only transition from
"State A" to "State B"
- Manage the state transitions of parent work items
based on the state changes of their child work items
Apply rules based on user or group
membership of the user modifying a
work item.
Specify rules that restrict a group from creating a
work item, transitioning a work item to a closed or
completed state, or changing the value of a field
There are some restrictions for applying custom rules to system fields. For example, you
can't specify rules that set or clear the value for Area Path or Iteration Path as they're
system fields. For more information, see Rules and rule evaluation and Sample rule
scenarios.
You can specify who can add or edit query folders or queries at the object-level. To
manage permissions for a query or query folder, be the creator of the query or folder, a
member of the Project Administrators or Project Collection Administrators group or
granted explicit access through the object's Security dialog.

Delivery Plans are an object within a project. You can manage permissions for each plan
like the way you manage permissions for shared queries or query folders. The creator of
a Delivery Plan and all members of the Project Collection Administrators and Project
Administrators groups have permissions to edit, manage, and delete plans.
Users granted Stakeholder access for private projects have no access to delivery plans,

permanently delete work items and test artifacts. Project admins can grant permissions
to other team members as needed.
For example, as a project admin you can grant a user, team group, or other group
you've created to have these permissions. Open the Security page for the project and
choose the user or group you want to grant permissions. To learn how to access project-
level Security, see Change project-level permissions.
In the following example, we granted members who are assigned to the team
administrator role, and who belong to the Team Admin group, permissions to move
work items to another project and permanently delete work items.
Move or permanently delete work items
７ Note
The Move work items out of this project permission requires the Inherited process
model for the project.


# Page 172

In addition to the project-level permissions set in the previous section, team members
need permissions to manage test artifacts that are set for an area path.
Open the Security page for area paths and choose the user or group you want to grant
permissions.
Manage test plans and test suites


# Page 173

Set the permissions for Manage test plans and Manage test suites to Allow.
To have full access to the Test feature set, your access level must be set to Basic + Test
Plans. Users with Basic access and with permissions to permanently delete work items
and manage test artifacts can only delete orphaned test cases.

Manage access to specific features
Article • 11/28/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Managing access to specific features in Azure DevOps can be crucial for maintaining the
right balance of openness and security. Whether you're looking to grant or restrict
access to certain functionalities for a group of users, understanding the flexibility
beyond the standard permissions provided by built-in security groups is key.
If you're new to the permissions and groups landscape, see Get started with
permissions, access, and security groups. This article covers the essentials of permission
states and how they inherit.
Permissions: Be a member of the Project Collection Administrators group. Organization
owners are automatically members of this group.
For optimal maintenance, we recommend using the default security groups or
establishing custom security groups to manage permissions. The permission settings for
the Project Administrators and Project Collection Administrators groups are fixed by
design and can't be altered. However, you have the flexibility to modify permissions for
all other groups.
Managing permissions for a few users individually might seem feasible, but custom
security groups provide a more organized approach. They streamline the oversight of
roles and their associated permissions, ensuring clarity and ease of management design
 Tip
The structure of your project in Azure DevOps plays a pivotal role in determining
the granularity of permissions at an object level, such as repositories and area
paths. This structure is the foundation that allows you to fine-tune access controls,
enabling you to specifically delineate which areas are accessible or restricted. For
more information, see About projects and scaling your organization.
Prerequisites
Use security groups


# Page 181

and can't be altered. But, you have the flexibility to modify permissions for all other
groups.
As an administrator or organization owner, delegating administrative tasks to team
members who oversee specific areas is a strategic approach. The primary built-in roles
equipped with predefined permissions and role assignments include:
Readers: Have read-only access to the project.
Contributors: Can contribute to the project by adding or modifying content.
Team Administrator: Manage team-related settings and permissions.
Project Administrators: Have administrative rights over the project.
Project Collection Administrators: Oversee the entire project collection and have
the highest level of permissions.
These roles facilitate the distribution of responsibilities and streamline the management
of project areas.
For for more information, see Default permissions and access and Change project
collection-level permissions.
To delegate tasks to other members within your organization, consider creating a
custom security group and then granting permissions as indicated in the following table.

In addition to assigning permissions to individuals, you can manage permissions for
various objects within Azure DevOps. These objects include:
Git repositories
Git branches
TFVC repositories
Build and release pipelines
Wikis.
These links provide detailed steps and guidelines for setting up and managing
permissions effectively for the respective areas in Azure DevOps.
Limit user visibility to organization and project
information
） Important
The limited visibility features described in this section apply only to
interactions through the web portal. With the REST APIs or azure devops  CLI
commands, project members can access the restricted data.
Guest users who are members in the limited group with default access in
Microsoft Entra ID, can't search for users with the people picker. When the
preview feature's turned off for the organization, or when guest users aren't
members of the limited group, guest users can search all Microsoft Entra
users, as expected.


# Page 184

By default, when users get added to an organization, they gain visibility into all
organizational and project information and settings. To tailor this access, the Limit user
visibility and collaboration to specific projects preview feature can be enabled at the
organizational level. For more information, see Manage preview features.
Once this feature is activated, users who are part of the Project-Scoped Users group
have limited visibility, unable to see most Organization settings. Their access is confined
to the projects they explicitly get added to, ensuring a more controlled and secure
environment.
For organizations integrated with Microsoft Entra ID, the people picker enables a
comprehensive search across all users and groups within Microsoft Entra ID, without
being limited to a single project.
The people picker supports the following Azure DevOps functionalities:
Selecting user identities: Choose users from work tracking identity fields like
Assigned To.
@mentions in discussions:
Use @mention to select users or groups in various discussions and comments,
including:
Work item discussions
Pull request discussions
Commit comments
Comments on changesets and shelvesets
@mentions in wiki pages: Use @mention to select users or groups within wiki
pages.
２ Warning
Enabling the Limit user visibility and collaboration to specific projects preview
feature prevents project-scoped users from searching for users added to the
organization through Microsoft Entra group membership, rather than through an
explicit user invitation. This is an unexpected behavior, and a resolution is in
progress. To resolve this issue, disable the Limit user visibility and collaboration to
specific projects preview feature for the organization.
Limit the people picker to project users and
groups


# Page 185

As you enter into the people picker, it displays matching user names or security groups,
as illustrated in the following example.
Azure DevOps is designed to allow all authorized users to view all defined objects within
the system. However, you can tailor access to resources by setting the permission state
to Deny. You can set permissions for members who belong to a custom security group
or for individual users. For more information, see Request an increase in permission
levels.

For users and groups within the Project-scoped users group, visibility and selection
are limited to users and groups within their connected project. To extend the
people picker's scope to include all project members, see Manage your
organization: Limit identity search and selection.

About Kanban boards
Article • 06/10/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
A Kanban board in Azure DevOps is a visual tool used to manage work items and track
progress in a project. It provides a clear overview of tasks, their status, and their flow
through different stages. Teams can use Kanban boards to visualize work, limit work in
progress, and optimize their workflow. Each work item is represented as a card on the
board, and columns represent different stages, such as "To Do," "In Progress," and
"Done." As work progresses, cards move across columns, allowing teams to monitor and
improve their efficiency. Kanban boards are commonly used in agile methodologies and
are essential for effective project management.
Both Kanban boards and Taskboards support visualizing the flow of work and
monitoring metrics to optimize that flow. Kanban boards track requirements are sprint-
independent, and provide a cumulative flow chart for monitoring progress. Each sprint is
associated with a Taskboard that supports tracking tasks defined for the sprint. You can
monitor progress through capacity charts and the sprint burndown chart. For more
information, see Update and monitor your Taskboard.
Each product and portfolio backlog corresponds to a board. These boards are
associated with teams and display work items based on the selected area and iteration
paths. For more information, see Define and configure iterations.
To enhance consistent delivery of high-quality software, Kanban emphasizes two key
practices. First, visualize the flow of work by mapping your team's workflow stages and
configuring the board appropriately. Second, constrain work in progress, by setting
work-in-progress (WIP) limits. With these practices in place, you can track progress and
monitor metrics to reduce lead or cycle time. Get started by exploring how to use your
board.
７ Note
Kanban is a Japanese word that literally translates to "signboard." In this article, we
focus on Kanban boards, but moving forward, we refer the them as "boards."
Product and portfolio boards


# Page 189

The following table outlines terms and tools commonly used for tracking work with
Kanban boards and Kanban methods.
Concept or
term
Description
Blocker
An issue that prevents work from progressing. You can highlight work that is
blocked by using tags and changing the card color. For more information, see
Customize cards, Define style rules to highlight cards.
Bottleneck
A constraint in the system that limits the flow of work. Identifying bottlenecks
makes it easier to reduce their effect and provides a mechanism for controlling
work flowing through the process. For more information, see Manage columns,
Identify bottlenecks.
Card
reordering
Card reordering lets you change the priority order and forces cards to maintain
the backlog priority when you drag and drop them on the board. For more
information, see Reorder cards.
Cumulative
flow diagram
(CFD)
The in-context CFD report shows the count of items in each column for the past
30 weeks or less. From this chart, you can gain an idea of the amount of work in
progress and lead time. Work in progress counts unfinished requirements. For
more information, see Cumulative flow, lead time, and cycle time guidance.
Cycle time
Cycle time is the time calculated for a work item from first entering an In Progress
category state to entering a Completed state category. For more information, see
Cumulative flow, lead time, and cycle time guidance. You can gain valuable

metrics and visualize the cycle time for a team and a configurable time period by
adding the Cycle Time widget to the dashboard.
Definition of
done
Criteria that a team specifies for each stage of work to share and standardize on
what makes up work being done at that stage.
Kanban board
An interactive, electronic sign board that supports visualization of the flow of
work from concept to completion and lean methods. Azure DevOps provides a
board for each product and portfolio backlog. For more information, see Board
basics and Board features and epics and Track work in swimlanes.
Columns
A column maps to a stage of work. The default columns map to the workflow
states of the work item types that appear on the board. You configure the
columns to map workflow states of your team. For more information, see Map
the flow.
Lead time
Lead time is the time calculated for a work item from first entering a Proposed
category state to entering a Completed state category. For more information, see
Cumulative flow, lead time, and cycle time guidance. You can gain valuable
metrics and visualize the lead time for a team and a configurable time period by
adding the Lead Time widget to the dashboard.
Product
backlog
An interactive list of work items that corresponds to a team's project plan or
roadmap for what the team plans to deliver. The product backlog supports
prioritizing work, forecasting work by sprints, and quickly linking work to
portfolio backlog items. You can define your backlog items and then manage
their status using the board. Each team can customize its product backlog. For
more information, see Create your backlog.
Product
backlog item
A type of work item that defines the applications, requirements, and elements
that teams plan to create. Product owners typically define and stack rank product
backlog items, which are defined with the Scrum process. For more information,
see Scrum process work item types and workflow.
Portfolio
backlog
An interactive list of work items, similar to the product backlog that supports
organizing or grouping work under features epics, or scenarios. Portfolio
backlogs work similarly to product backlogs in that you can prioritize work and
view the tree hierarchy of work. For more information, see Define features and
epics.
Swimlanes
A swimlane is a configurable row on a board, used to support different service
class levels of work. For more information, see Speed up work with swimlanes.
Split columns
The Split columns feature lets your team implement a pull mechanism within the
workflow process. Without split columns, teams push work forward, to signal that
they completed their stage of work. However, pushing it to the next stage
doesn't necessarily mean that a team member immediately starts work on that

term
Description
item. With split columns, your team knows exactly how many items sit idle,
waiting for work to begin. For more information, see Manage columns.
Task
checklists
A task is a type of work item used to track work required to complete a user story
or product backlog item. You can add tasks from your board that appear as a
checklist of work to be done. As you complete a task, you can update its status
by checking the checkbox for the task. For more information, see Add tasks or
child items as checklists.
Task
switching
Task switching, also referred to as context switching or multitasking, is when a
team member shifts their attention among different tasks. Limiting task switching
can allow a person to work more efficiently by minimizing the amount of time
required to redirect cognitive function to a new activity.
User story
A type of work item that defines the applications, requirements, and elements
that teams plan to create. Product owners typically define and stack rank user
stories. User story is defined with the Agile process. For more information, see
Agile process work item types and workflow.
Work in
progress
(WIP)
Work that is started but isn't done or completed.
WIP limit
A WIP limit is a constraint that a team applies to one or more workflow stages to
help prevent potential bottlenecks that hinder the continuous flow of work in the
system. For more information, see Work in Progress limits.
Workflow
states
Workflow states are defined for each work item type to support tracking the
status of a work item, from its creation to its completion. These states define the
workflow process: actions, steps, or stages that a piece of work goes through
from inception to completion. The State and Reason fields differ depending on
the work item type and process selected for the project. For more information,
see Customize the workflow.
Workflow
state
categories
State categories determine how the board treats each workflow state. The state
categories used by the backlogs are Proposed, In Progress, Resolved, and
Completed. For more information, see Workflow states and state categories.

Along with these team configurations, you can customize your project by adding or
modifying work item types, the workflow, and add customized portfolio backlogs and
boards.
Answer: No. Each team controls their own team settings and board configurations.
Once you configure your board, you can add work items directly to the board. Update
the status of work by dragging a card to another column on the board. You can even
change the order of items as you move a card to a new column. For more information,
see Workflow states and state categories.
Can you define a board configuration that multiple teams
can subscribe to?
Update work item status


# Page 194

You can create a hierarchy of backlog items, tasks, and bugs. We don't recommend that
you create same-category hierarchies. In other words, don't create parent-child links
among work items of the same type, such as story-story, bug-bug, or task-task.
The last node in a same-category hierarchy might only appear on boards, sprint
backlogs, and Taskboards. For example, if you link items within a same-category
hierarchy that is four levels deep, only the items at the fourth level appear on the board,
sprint backlog, and taskboard.
Rather than nest requirements, bugs, and tasks, we recommend that you maintain a flat
list. Create parent-child links one level deep between items that belong to a different
category. For more information, see Troubleshoot reordering and nesting issues.
All backlogs and boards support drag-and-drop to reorder and reparent work items.
Updates made to one team's backlogs and boards are reflected in other team backlogs
and boards that share the same area path. You might need to refresh the page to view
the changes.
You can only use drag-and-drop to reorder or reparent work items assigned to area
paths selected for your team. When the Parents view option is enabled, work items
might appear on your backlog that your team doesn't own. Anything that appears with
the 
 information icon can't be reordered nor reparented as another team owns it.

Each team can customize the board columns and swimlanes. The values that get
assigned to board fields might differ from what you expect when another team updates
the work item from a different board.
Even if the management team and the feature teams configure their board columns with
identical workflow mapping, one team's board items aren't reflected on another team's
board. Only when the work item moves to a column that maps to a workflow state does
the card column reflect the same on all boards.
For more information, see Manage columns.
As a member added to the Contributors group of a project, you can use most features
provided under Boards or Work. Users with Basic access have full access to all features.
Users with Stakeholder access are limited to certain features.
For more information, see Set permissions and access for work tracking and Stakeholder
access quick reference. To add users to a project, see Add users to a project or team.

Boards provide an intuitive and visual way to manage your projects, track work items,
and collaborate with your team effectively. If you have a project, you already have a
board. Let's get started!
Boards automatically get created when you create a project or add a team. Each team
has access to their own product and portfolio boards as described in About teams and
Agile tools.
Project and team access:
Connect to a project.
Add yourself to a team or project.
Access levels:
Have at least Basic access to add work items and use all board features.
Users with Stakeholder access:
Public project: Full access to board features, similar to users with Basic access.
Private project: Can add work items and update status through drag-and-
drop but can't update fields displayed on cards, and can add tasks and
change task status.
Permissions:
Set View work items in this node and Edit work items in this node permissions
to Allow to view or modify work items. By default, the Contributors group has
these permissions. For more information, see Set permissions and access for
work tracking.
７ Note
You can only create or add boards to a project by adding another team. Boards
only get created when a project or team gets created. For more information, see
About teams and Agile tools.
Prerequisites
７ Note


# Page 198

1. Check that you selected the right project, and select Boards > Boards. Then select
the correct team from the team selector menu.
To select another team's board, open the selector. Then select a different team, or
select the 
 Browse all team boards option. Or, you can enter a keyword in the
search box to filter the list of team backlogs for the project.
Visualize and optimize work flow with both boards and Taskboards.
Boards: Ideal for tracking requirements, independent of sprints, and
equipped with a cumulative flow chart for progress tracking.
Taskboards: Linked to specific sprints, they facilitate task tracking within
the sprint.
Progress monitoring: Achieved through detailed capacity charts and sprint
burndown charts.
For information about Taskboard usage and best practices, see Update and
monitor your Taskboard.
Open your board from the web portal


# Page 199

2. Check that you selected Backlog items for Scrum, Stories for Agile, or
Requirements for CMMI as the backlog level.
To switch to the product backlog, select Stories backlog. To switch to a Taskboard, see
Update and monitor your Taskboard.
When you first open your board, there's one column for each workflow state. Your actual
columns vary based on the process used to create your project.
1. Identify your team's workflow stages, which most likely don't map to the default
states. For your team to have a functional board, configure the board to match
 Tip
Select the 
 star icon to make a team board a favorite. Favorite artifacts (

Map the flow of how your team works


# Page 200

your workflow stages.
For example, for user stories, the New, Active, Resolved, and Closed states track
progress from idea to completion.
2. Manage your columns, so they match your workflow stages. Keep the number of
columns to a minimum while still representing the key handoffs that occur for your
team.
Set work in progress (WIP) limits for each workflow stage, so that when work items
exceed the limit, the column count displays as red. Teams can use this color as a signal
Set WIP limits


# Page 201

to focus immediately on activities to bring the number of items in the column down. For
more information, see Set WIP limits.
See the estimated size of work for each item that displays at the bottom right of each
card. Add items to your backlog in the first column. When priorities change, move items
up and down within a column. And, as work completes in one stage, update the status
of an item by moving it to a downstream stage.
Update your board as work progresses to help keep your team in sync. Also, you can see
and share the value stream your team is delivering to customers.
Track work in progress
） Important
Work items that appear on more than one team's board can yield results that don't
meet your expectations because each team can customize its board columns and
swimlanes. The values assigned to Board Column, Board Column Done, and Board
Lane fields might differ from what you expect when another team updates the
work item from a different board. For more information, see Add, review, and
update work items in Azure Boards.


# Page 202

To add a work item, select the 
 plus sign, enter a title, and then select Enter.
The system automatically saves the work item with the title you entered. You can add as
many work items you want by using this method.
To add details to any work item, select the title. Or, you can directly modify any field that
displays. For example, you can reassign a work item by selecting Assigned To. For a
description of each field, see Create your backlog, Add details, and estimates. You can
also add tasks or child items as checklists on your cards.
As work completes in one stage, update the status of an item by dragging it to a
downstream stage.
Add work items
７ Note
You can only assign work to a single user. If you need to assign work to more than
one user, add a work item for each user and distinguish the work to be done by
title and description. The Assigned To field only accepts user accounts that have
been added to a project or team.
Update work item status
７ Note
Completed or closed work items don't display on the backlogs and boards after
their Changed Date value is greater than 183 days (about a half a year). You can
still list these items by using a query. If you want them to show up on a backlog or
board, you can make a minor change to them, which resets the clock.


# Page 203

You can quickly update a field or reassign ownership directly from the board. If the field
you want to update isn't showing, then customize the card, so it displays. You can also
show other work item types besides bug and user stories, like change requests,
incidents, issues, or other custom work item types. For more information, see Customize
cards and About configuring and customizing Azure Boards.
You can apply filters interactively to focus on a subset of work. For example, you can
filter the board to focus on work assigned to at team member for a specific sprint. To
start filtering, choose Filter 
 . For more information, see Filter your backlogs, boards,
and plans.
In the following example image, we filtered all items assigned to Jamal and Raisa.

All members of a project can view and contribute to your board. To invite users to
contribute, copy the URL of your board and send it to those users.
To add users to your project, see Add users to a project.
As with most Agile practices, you're encouraged to monitor key metrics to fine tune
your processes. After your team uses the board for several weeks, check out your

Add tasks or child items as checklist
items
Article • 11/18/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Your board in Azure DevOps lets you visualize your team’s tasks, track progress, and
manage work items efficiently. This article provides step-by-step instructions on how to
add task checklists to your board, enhancing your team’s productivity and transparency.
The following image shows a representation of various tasks and bugs in progress.
Some are still pending, while others are marked as completed. By incorporating the
Issue work item type into your Iteration backlog, you can seamlessly add issues as
checklists
Make use of the following features for checklists.
Enable checklists on all boards (product and portfolio levels).
Create parent-child links by adding checklist items to work items.
For product-level boards:
Manage Bugs with tasks: Add and track them within checklists.
Manage Bugs with requirements: Add tasks to bugs tracked on the board.
Learn checklist features


# Page 209

Mark checklist items as “done” to update work item states.
Customize checklist features in the Board settings.
Automatically assign child items to the sprint/iteration path of parent work items.
Add any work item type using the checklist feature.
To track work item types as checklists, add them to the next-lower hierarchical
backlog. For more information, see Customize backlogs/boards (Inheritance
process) or Process configuration XML element reference (on-premises XML
process).
Boards automatically get created when you create a project or add a team. Each team
has access to their own product and portfolio boards as described in About teams and
Agile tools.
Access levels:
Be a project member.
Have at least Basic access to add work items and use all board features.
Users with Stakeholder access:
Public project: Full access to board features, similar to users with Basic access.
Private project: Can add work items and update status through drag-and-
drop but can't update fields displayed on cards, and can add tasks and
change task status.
Permissions:
Set View work items in this node and Edit work items in this node permissions
to Allow to view or modify work items. By default, the Contributors group has
these permissions. For more information, see Set permissions and access for
work tracking.
 Tip
You can disable it from the common configurations dialog.
Prerequisites
７ Note
Visualize and optimize work flow with both boards and Taskboards.
Boards: Ideal for tracking requirements, independent of sprints, and
equipped with a cumulative flow chart for progress tracking.

Add board features and epics
Article • 01/13/2025
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
If you track progress on your backlog with a board, you can also use boards to track
epics and features.
And, as with child task checklists for backlog items, you can quickly define and track the
progress of child items for your features or epics. Here we see several stories defined for
features, both in progress and completed.
For more information, see Define features and epics.
Boards automatically get created when you create a project or add a team. Each team
has access to their own product and portfolio boards as described in About teams and
Agile tools.
Access levels:
Project member.
At least Basic access to add work items and use all board features.
Users with Stakeholder access:
Public project: Full access to board features, similar to users with Basic access.

Interactively filter backlogs, boards,
queries, and plans in Azure Boards
Article • 11/22/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Filter functions in Azure Boards empower you to interactively apply one or more filters
to streamline your work item management. Each Azure Boards tool—such as Backlogs,
Boards, and Query results—comes prefiltered to display a relevant subset of work items
based on its specific functionality:
Backlogs and boards: Show work items based on the selected Area Paths and
Iteration Paths for your team.
Query results: List work items that match the query clauses you defined.
To enhance your filtering capabilities, enable the filter feature by selecting the 
 Filter
icon.
Even with these initial filters, you might still encounter a large number of work items.
Interactive filtering allows you to narrow down your view and focus on a specific subset
of work items by applying more filter criteria to each Azure Boards tool.
Filters can significantly enhance your workflow by helping you accomplish the following
tasks:
Daily scrum meetings: Focus the board on work assigned for a specific sprint to
facilitate effective stand-ups.
Sprints Taskboard: Filter to view a particular team member's completed work,
aiding in performance reviews and accountability.
Group work items: Concentrate on related work items by filtering based on Parent
Work Item, Area Path, or Tags, enhancing organization and clarity.
Triage work items: Create and apply queries to isolate similar work items grouped
by Area Path or Tags, enabling efficient issue resolution and backlog grooming.
Use cases for filters


# Page 223

By using these filter functions, your team can maintain focus, improve productivity, and
ensure that critical tasks receive the attention they deserve.
For more detailed information on using filters, see Filter Backlogs, Boards, and Plans.
Project access: Be a project member.
Filter functions are available from all Azure Boards tools: Work items, Boards, Backlogs,
Sprint Backlogs and Taskboards, Queries, and Delivery Plans. The set of features
supported depends on the tool and Azure DevOps version. (Use the content selector to
view the filters available for your version.)
The following table indicates the supported options based on the tool indicated with a
✔️ or is listed.
Backlogs and boards are subject to filters defined for the team as described in Set up

Notes
1. While the Parent Work Item isn't a filter function for Backlogs or Query Results,
you can add the Parent field as a column and then do a keyword/phrase search on
the Parent title to effectively filter on parent work items. The Parent field is
supported for Azure DevOps Server 2020 and later versions. See also the Parent
field and Parent Work Item section later in this article.
2. The Parent Work Item filter is supported for Sprint Backlogs and Taskboards for
Azure DevOps Server 2020 and later versions.
Along with the standard filter functions summarized in the previous table, the following

Notes
1. The Work items page is subject to filters based on the view selected. Boards and
Backlogs are subject to filters defined for the team as described in Set up your
Backlogs and Boards. Completed and In Progress work items get determined
based on the state categories assigned to the workflow state as described in How
workflow states and state categories are used in Backlogs and Boards.
2. Grouping is supported through portfolio backlogs and boards, parent-child links,
and tree hierarchy. Tree hierarchies are flattened when filtering is applied and
reinstated when filtering is cleared.
3. Backlogs and Sprint Backlogs support reordering. However, when filtering is
enabled, reordering isn't supported.
4. Taskboards provides a Group by function based on People or Stories.
5. Query Results supports multi-column sort.
6. Work items appear in the order defined for the team Sprint backlog, which it
inherits from the team product backlog.
7. Semantic search supports sorting search results by the following fields—Assigned
To, Changed Date, Created Date, ID, State, Tags, Title, and Work Item Type—and
Relevance.
For more information about these other functions, see the following articles:
Reorder cards (boards)
Display rollup progress or totals
About backlogs, Work with multi-team ownership of backlog items


# Page 229

The Parent Work Item filter enables you to focus on one or more select features or
epics. This filter function was added in July 2016 and made available in Azure DevOps
Server 2017 and later versions.
The Parent field was added to Azure Boards in July of 2019 and then made available
with the release of Azure DevOps Server 2020. You can add the Parent field to a list
through the Column Options dialog, except for the Work items tool. You can also add
the Parent field to cards on the boards and Taskboards.
Once you set filter options for a specific view, your settings persist until you modify
them. There's no need to select a save button or take any other actions.
To filter work items based on specific fields, first add the field as a column or to the card.
For example, to filter by Assigned To, Iteration Path, Work Item Type, or any other
field's content, ensure these fields are displayed on the cards, backlog, plan, or list.
All filter configurations are user-specific and remain active until you clear them.
To add columns or fields, see the following articles:
For Backlogs and Queries, see Change column options
For Boards, see Customize cards
For Taskboards, see Customize a sprint Taskboard
For Plans, see Review team delivery plans.
1. From the Azure Boards tool, choose the view you want. For example:
For Work items, select Assigned to me, Following, Mentioned, or other view.
For Backlogs and Boards, select the backlog level you want, such as Stories,
Features, or Epics.
For sprint Backlogs and Taskboards, choose the iteration
For queries, define the query filter criteria of interest.

# Page 230

2. Choose any other view settings available for your view. For example:
For Work items, from the View options menu, enable/disable Completed
Work Items.
For Backlogs, from the View options menu, enable/disable In Progress items
or Completed Child items.
For Taskboards, from the Person menu, choose All, Unassigned, or a specific
team member.
3. For list views, add columns to display fields containing text you want to filter on or
possibly sort on. For card views, add fields to display on cards containing text you
want to filter on.
4. Select Filter 
 . Or, enter the Ctrl+Shift+f keyboard shortcut.
For example, here we open the filter toolbar for the board, Backlog items.
::: moniker-end
5. Choose your filters of interest.
The filter icon changes to a solid icon, Filter 
 , to indicate filtering is applied.
The page refreshes to show only those work items that meet all the selected filter
criteria.
When filtering is applied, the following functions are disabled or altered:
For backlogs, the add-a-backlog-item panel, reordering (stack ranking), and
forecasting tools are disabled.
For backlogs set to Show Parents, the tree hierarchy is flattened, unless you enable
the Keep hierarchy with filters from the View Options menu. See [Filter your
backlog and maintain the hierarchy](#keep hierarchy) provided later in this article.
To clear and dismiss filtering, choose Clear and dismiss filtering 
 .
Inactive functions
Clear or dismiss filtering


# Page 231

Filters remain in place until you explicitly clear them. When you refresh your backlog,
board, or other tool, or sign in from another browser, filters remain set to your previous
values.
Once the board is filtered, you can choose the filter icon to hide the drop downs and
view the applied filters on the board. The filter icon turns opaque to signify a filtered
board.
You can filter your backlog and maintain the hierarchy of work by choosing show
Parents and Keep hierarchy with filters from the View Options menu. Use these options
when you want to show work items assigned to one or more team members, work item
types, area or iteration paths, or combination of these items and keywords. The
hierarchy is maintained and work items that match the filter criteria are shown in bold
text.
Filter your backlog and maintain the hierarchy


# Page 232

Applying Boolean operators to filters is only supported for tags, as described in Filter
based on tags later in this article. All other filters are applied with an implicit AND
operator.
The keyword filter allows you to search lists or cards based on the fields configured
through Column Options or board settings. You can filter by specific values, such as IDs
even if the ID field is visible. When using the keyword filter, ensure that the fields
containing the desired text or tags are displayed in your view.
The filter criteria ignore the following characters: ,  (comma), .  (period), /  (forward
slash), and \  (back slash).
Here we filter the board to only show those cards that include 'web' either in the title,
tag, or field.

 Tip
Filtering is case-insensitive.

Filter a board using a keyword


# Page 233

Here we filter the Backlog with Show Parents enabled, to only show work items that
include 'web'.
The filtered set is always a flat list, even if you selected to show parents.
With filtering turned on, choose one or more values from the multi-select drop-down
menu for each field available to you. The values for these fields are populated as follows:
Area: The Node Name, which specifies the last node of an Area Path, of valid Area
Paths and for which there are work items assigned to that Area Path
Assigned To: All users who are currently assigned to work items on the board plus
Unassigned
Iteration: All Iteration Paths selected for the current team and for which there are
work items assigned to that iteration
Work item type: Work item types defined for the Requirements Category (product
backlog) or Features or Epic categories (feature or epic portfolio backlogs), subject
to work items being assigned to the work item types
Tags: All tags assigned to work items on the board
Parent Work Items: All features defined for the team, or all epics defined for the
team when viewing the Features board
Filter a backlog by using a keyword
Filter based on a field
７ Note


# Page 234

You can filter by select field values using the board for your product backlog (Stories,
Product Backlog Items, or Requirements) or a portfolio backlog (Features or Epics).
For example, here we filter for all items assigned to Jamal and Raisa.
Cards are filtered based on the assignments made in the following order and logic:
1. Assigned to: Show all cards that are assigned to user 1 OR  user 2 AND
2. Iteration: Show all cards that are assigned to Iteration 1 OR  Iteration 2 AND
3. Work Item type: Show all cards that are work item type 1 OR  work item type 2 AND
4. Tags: Show all cards that have tag 1 AND  or OR  tags 2, based on your selection of
AND | OR . AND
5. Parent Work Items: Show all cards that have Parent Work Item 1 OR  Parent Work
Item 2.
Filter options are dependent on the work items that meet the filter criteria. For
example, if you don't have any work items assigned to Sprint 4, then the Sprint 4
option won't appear in the filter options for the Iteration Path.
The values that populate the filter options are based on the work items that are
currently loaded and displayed. For example, if you have a backlog with 2,000 work
items, but only 1,000 are displayed on a board, the filter options are based on just
the items displayed.
Filter a board by using select field values
Board filter logic


# Page 235

Here we show a filtered backlog based on the keyword "issues." Filtered pages show the
 filtered icon. The filtered set is always a flat list, even if you selected to show a
hierarchical backlog view.
You can use the Filter by parent feature to filter by select parent work items using the
board for your product backlog (Stories, Product Backlog Items, or Requirements) or a
portfolio backlog (Features).
Use this feature only when you created features or epics and linked them to user stories
or features, respectively. A quick and easy way to create the links is to map them using
drag-and-drop. Mapping creates parent-child links between the work items.
To start filtering, choose Filter 
 . Choose one or more values from the multi-select
drop-down menu for the Parent Work Item. These values are derived from the Features
you defined.
Here, we choose two features on which to filter the board:
Filter a backlog by using fields
Filter based on the Parent Work Item
７ Note
The Filter by parent feature doesn't support filtering of parent work items of the
same work item type. For example, you can't filter the Stories backlog by specifying
user stories that are parents of nested user stories.


# Page 236

The final board displays just those stories linked as child work items to the selected
features.
If you added tags to your work items, you can filter your work using one or more tags.
For backlogs and query results, add Tags as a column option before filtering on tags.
Check the boxes of those tags that you want to filter on. Keep the OR selection to do a
logical OR for all the tags you selected. Or, choose the AND option to do a logical AND
on all the selected tags.
Filter based on tags


# Page 237

For more information about tags, see Add tags to work items to categorize and filter
lists and boards.
In addition to all the filter features described earlier in this article, you can also filter the
history view within a work item form.
To quickly find revisions made that contain a keyword, or made by specific people or to
a specific field, enable the filter feature by choosing 
 Toggle filter.

Add, run, and update inline tests
Article • 11/22/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Similar to task checklists, you can quickly define inline tests, or a set of manual tests
cases, for a backlog item from your board. Not only can you add tests, you can run them
and update their status. If you're new to working with the board, see Kanban board
overview. If you're new to testing, see Exploratory and manual testing scenarios and
capabilities.
Tests that you create from the board automatically get linked to the user story or
backlog item.
Project and team access:
Connect to a project. If you don't have a project, create one.
Add yourself to a team or project.
Access levels: To add work items, view or run tests, and use all boards features,
have at least Basic access. Users with Stakeholder access can't view or run tests.
Permissions:
To view or modify work items, set View work items in this node and Edit work
items in this node permissions to Allow. By default, the Contributors group has

# Page 240

these permissions. For more information, see Set permissions and access for
work tracking.
1. To view your board, open your project from a web browser and choose (1) Work,
(2) Boards, and then (3) select the team's board from the selector.
To choose another team's board, open the selector and select a different team or
choose the 
 Browse all team boards option. Or, you can enter a keyword in the
search box to filter the list of team backlogs for the project.

 Tip
Choose the 
 star icon to favorite a team board. Favorited artifacts (
favorited icon) appear at the top of the team selector list.
Add inline tests


# Page 242

Adding inline tests is the same as adding test cases to a test suite. A default test
plan and test suite automatically get created under which the manual test cases
are grouped.
For example, a test suite is created for each user story, and all inline tests get
added to that suite. In the following example, test suite 152 is highlighted which
has three manual tests defined with IDs of 280, 281, and 282.
For more information, see Plan your tests.


# Page 243

2. If you have many tests to add, keep entering each title and select Enter.
To add details to the test case, open it. You can select the title, double-click the
inline item, or open the context menu and choose Open.

About configuring and customizing
Azure Boards
Article • 03/15/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
You can configure and customize Azure Boards in many ways, to better manage your
portfolio, dependencies, and monitoring. We recommend the tasks covered in this
article especially for administrators who are responsible for managing multi-team
projects.
Quick access to common tasks:
Customize cards | Manage columns | Expedite work with swimlanes | Configure your
backlog.
If you're just getting started as a Project Administrator, see also Get started as an
administrator.
To make the most of Azure Boards, understand how your teams use their tools and
functions (for example, Scrum, Kanban, and Scrumban), and their dependencies on
configurations and customizations. The following table summarizes the primary items
you should consider as you structure your project.
Project level
How many teams you want to define
How to structure area paths to support portfolio management views
Field customizations
Custom work item types (WITs)
Portfolio backlog customizations
７ Note
Most of the guidance in this article is valid for both the cloud and on-premises
versions. However, some of the features included in this article, such as Rollup,
Analytics, and some portfolio planning tools, are only available for the cloud at this
time.
Considerations


# Page 250

Workflow customizations
Team level
How you use your product backlog to plan and prioritize your work
Whether you track bugs as requirements or as tasks, or not use bugs at all
Whether or not you use tasks to track time and capacity
How you use portfolio backlog levels
How you inform upper management of progress, status, and risks
Customize your work tracking building blocks and tools to support business needs and
communicate the usage guidelines to your team.
When you create a project in Azure Boards, you first select a process. Each process
(Agile, Basic, Scrum, and CMMI) supports a hierarchy of WITs, including product and
portfolio backlogs. Default WITs for each process are listed in corresponding tabs, with
backlogs under Requirements and tasks under Task.
The following image shows the hierarchy for the Agile process backlog work item:
User Stories and tasks are used to track work.
Bugs track code defects.
Epics and features are used to group work under larger scenarios.
Each team can configure how they manage Bug work items at the same level as
User Story or Task work items. Use the Working with bugs setting. For more
information about using these work item types, see Agile process.
Work item types and portfolio backlogs
Agile process


# Page 251

You can add custom WITs at each level, and even add custom portfolio backlogs. Here,
for example, is a project that added Objectives and Key Results as custom WITs and
corresponding portfolio backlogs to the Scrum process.
Teams can choose which WITs they use to track their work. The following table
summarizes the main options, recommended usage, and supported tasks and tools.
Work tracking options
Tasks and tools supported
Tasks only
Not recommended
There's no way to quickly enter new tasks in a backlog nor prioritize a backlog of tasks.
Also, there's no support for calendar views, cross-team views, or portfolio planning

Many teams start out using Scrum methods to track and plan their work using the tools
available through the Sprints hub. The Sprints tools support estimating and tracking
remaining work and use of capacity planning. If you don't plan on using these tools,
then adding child-dependent tasks is optional. Developers might add them as a
checklist of items they need to complete a user story or backlog requirement.
Requirements only, such as user stories (Agile), issues (Basic), product backlog items
(Scrum), requirements (CMMI)

Use area paths to group work items by product, feature, or business areas and to
support teams responsible for work assigned to those areas. You can define a
hierarchical set of area paths or a flat set. Typically, you define a hierarchical set of area
paths to support a business hierarchy that wants to track progress of several teams.
Area paths, product teams, and portfolio
management


# Page 255

The two main ways to group work items are by area path and by parenting them under
a portfolio WIT as described early in this article. The two aren't mutually exclusive. Here
are their differences:
Area paths assigned to a team determine what work items appear in a team view:
product backlog, portfolio backlog, delivery plans, or other portfolio planning tool
Grouping work items under a parent feature or epic determine what rollup views
are supported and how work appears in a portfolio planning tool
You can also assign tags to work items to group them for query and filter purposes. So
when you structure your teams and projects, make sure you understand how you use
these grouping tools to support your business needs. Your choices affect the use of
portfolio planning tools.
To perform the following tasks, you must define area paths:
Query and chart work items based on Area Path
Assign work to more than one team
Work with management and feature teams
Filter a backlog, query, board, or plan using Area Paths
To use the following tools, teams must subscribe to area paths:
Boards> all tools
Backlogs> all tools
Sprints> all tools
Delivery plans
Rollup
Analytics> all
Area paths and hierarchical grouping
Area path-dependent tools
 Tip
You can define your area path structure and assign area paths to teams. Or, you can
add a team and create the area path with the team name at that time. If teams are
fully independent, create a flat set of area paths. However, if you want to create a
hierarchy of teams, then you'll want to create a tree-hierarchy of area paths. For
more information, see Configure a hierarchy of teams.


# Page 256

Each project has a default team and default area path. In some cases, there's only one
team to plan and track work. As organizations grow, however, you might add more
teams to manage the backlog and sprints.
The following example shows area paths and their assignments to teams, which support
portfolio management views for the Account Management and Service Delivery teams.
For more information, see the following articles:
Portfolio management
About area paths
About teams and Agile tools
Agile culture.
Recommendations:
Consider what upper management needs to know and how to best support them
Consider how you want to use rollup both for a team and portfolio management
Define epics and scenarios for large initiatives that take two or more sprints to
complete
Create hierarchical area paths to support sub categories of features and product
areas
Define requirements for work that can be accomplished in a single sprint and can
be assigned to a single individual
Define tasks to track more granular details or when you want to track time spent
working
Area paths and team assignments


# Page 257

Most Azure Boards tools support a filtered view of work items based on area path or
iteration path. You can also apply more filters based on keyword, assignment, WIT, and
more.
Each team can choose how they want to manage bugs. Some teams like to track bugs
along with requirements on the backlog. Other teams like to track bugs as tasks
performed in support of a requirement. The bugs then appear on their Taskboard.
If you use the Scrum process, your default setup is to track bugs along with product
backlog items (PBIs). If you work in a project based on the Agile or CMMI processes,
bugs don't automatically appear on your backlog.
Determine with your team how you want to manage bugs. Then, change your team
settings accordingly.
To track issues or impediments along with your requirements or in a portfolio backlog,
add them to your custom Inherited process. For more information, see Customize your
backlogs or boards (Inheritance process).
 Tip
You can only assign a work item to a single individual. When you define work
items, consider how many work items you need and who to assign them to.
Choose the Node Name  field as a column option to view the leaf area node in a
backlog list or board card. For more information, see Customize cards.
Don't create parent-child links among work items of the same type, such as
story-story, bug-bug, task-task.
Bugs as requirements or tasks
 Tip
After you refresh a backlog or board and you don't see bugs where you expect
them, review How backlogs and boards display hierarchical (nested) items. Only
leaf nodes of nested items appear on sprint Taskboards.
System WITs on a backlog


# Page 258

Rollup columns allow you to view progress bars or totals of numeric fields or
descendant items within a hierarchy. Descendant items correspond to all child items
within the hierarchy. You can add one or more rollup columns to a product or portfolio
backlog.
Here we show Progress by all Work Items, which displays progress bars for ascendant
work items based on the percentage of closed descendant items.
Delivery Plans supports rollup views of epics, features, and other custom portfolio
backlogs.
Iteration paths support Scrum and Scrumban processes where work is assigned to a set
time period. Iteration paths allow you to group work into sprints, milestones, or other
event-specific or time-related period. Each iteration or sprint corresponds to a regular
Rollup, hierarchy, and portfolio management
Iteration paths sprints releases & versioning


# Page 259

time interval referred to as a sprint cadence. Typical sprint cadences are two weeks,
three weeks, or a month long. For more information, see About area and iteration paths.
Iteration paths can be a flat list, or grouped under release milestones as shown in the
following image.
While Iteration Paths don't affect board tools, you can use Iteration Paths as a filter on
boards. For more information, see Filter your board.
Define iteration paths and assign them to teams when you want to use the following
tools:
Assign work items to sprints using the Planning pane
Query and chart work items based on Iteration Path
Forecast your product backlog
Sprints> all tools
Delivery Plans, a calendar view of team deliverables
Velocity chart and Sprint burndown chart
 Tip
If a team hasn't subscribed or selected an iteration path, that iteration path won't
appear in a team view or tool.
Time tracking


# Page 260

Most organizations following Scrum processes use time estimates for Sprint capacity
planning. Azure Boards tools fully support tracking time for this purpose. The main field
used is the task Remaining Work  field, which typically zeros out at the end of the sprint.
However, some organizations require time tracking to support other purposes, such as
for billing or maintaining time allocation records. Time values for estimated work and
completed work are of interest. The Agile and CMMI processes provide these fields—
Original Estimate, Completed Work, Remaining Work—for use in tracking time. You can
use them for that purpose. However, Azure Boards provides limited native support for
time tracking. Instead, consider using a Marketplace extension
 to support your other
time tracking requirements.
Any change made to a process in a project impacts all teams in that project. Many
changes don't cause much disruption to the teams they support, but the following
changes do.
When you add custom fields to a WIT, it doesn’t directly affect any specific tool. Instead,
these fields become visible within the corresponding work items. For instance, if you
introduce a custom numeric field, you can utilize it for rollup calculations on backlogs.
Also, you can use this custom field with the following reporting tools. So, while the
effect isn’t tool-specific, it does enhance your ability to tailor work items to your
project’s needs.
In-context Velocity report and dashboard widget
In-context Sprint Burndown report and dashboard widget
Dashboard Burndown and Burnup widget
７ Note
The Original Estimate , Completed Work , Remaining Work  fields were designed to
support integration with Microsoft Project. Integration support with Microsoft
Project is deprecated for Azure DevOps Server 2019 and later versions, including
the cloud service.
Process changes that affect all teams

７ Note


# Page 261

The following table shows the effects when you add a custom WIT to a specific category.
Task
Requirement
Epic or feature
Child work items of the new WIT appear on the product backlog
Work items based on the new WIT appear on the sprint backlogs and Taskboards
Work items based on the new WIT appear on the product backlog and \board
Each team must configure the \board to support the new WIT
Work items based on the new WIT appear on the corresponding portfolio backlogs
and boards
Each team must configure the \boards to support the new WIT
The new WITs might not appear on one or more of the portfolio planning tools
Each process supports a default workflow. This workflow defines the default columns
that appear on the boards and sprint Taskboards.
Workflow states: User Story, Agile process
All default and custom fields are shared across all projects in a collection or
organization. There is a limit of 1024 fields that you can define for a process.
Custom WITs
Custom workflow
Agile process


# Page 262

Sometimes, teams want to track the status of their work that goes beyond these default
states. Support is provided in one of the following ways:
Add custom workflow states to the WIT: This option impacts all teams and requires
that they update their board configuration.
Add columns to a board: This option only impacts the team that adds the columns.
Both workflow states and columns appear in the Cumulative Flow diagram for a team.
Individuals can choose which columns appear in the chart. For more information, see
Cumulative flow diagram.
Since process-level, project-level, and team-level settings can have a wide effect,
changes are restricted to users with the following required permissions.
To create, edit, or manage Inherited processes and apply them to projects, be a member
of the Project Collection Administrators group. Or, have the corresponding permissions

Manage columns on your board
Article • 11/11/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Managing columns on your board is essential for visualizing your team's workflow. Each
column corresponds to a stage of work, such as "To do," "In progress," and "Done." You
can customize these columns to match your specific process, while each card on the
board represents a work item, such as a user story, bug, or task.
Access levels: Have at least Basic access.
Permissions: To configure team settings, be part of the Project Administrators
security group or have the Team Administrator role. For more information, see
Change project-level permissions.
Tasks (optional): To avoid revisiting your configuration, we recommend doing the
following tasks before you begin to manage your board columns:
Add custom work item types
Customize your product and portfolio backlogs
Customize workflow states
Select backlog navigation levels for your team
Show bugs on backlogs and boards
Column titles and options vary based on the process used to create your project and
your team's decision to treat bugs as requirements or tasks.
Do the following steps to add and edit your columns:
７ Note
To manage columns on a sprint Taskboard, see Customize a Taskboard.
To manage columns on a backlog or in query results, see Change column
options.
To view frequently asked questions about Azure Boards, see FAQs.
Prerequisites
Add and edit columns


# Page 266

1. Sign in to your organization ( https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization} ).
2. Select Boards > Boards > Configure board settings 
 .
3. Select Columns.
To add a column, select + Add column.
To edit a column, select the column tab. For example, in the following image,
we choose to edit the Active column.


# Page 267

4. Do any of the following tasks for your columns. These tasks link to sections further
in this article:
Map workflow states to columns
Rename a column
Split columns
Add Definition of Done
5. Select Save.
Mapping workflow state categories to columns in boards is essential for visualizing the
progress of work items. It ensures that each state of a work item is represented on the
board, providing a clear and organized view of the workflow. This mapping helps teams
quickly identify the current status of work items, track their progress, and spot any
bottlenecks or issues. By aligning workflow states with board columns, teams can
maintain a shared understanding of the workflow and improve their ability to manage
and complete tasks efficiently.
Map workflow states to columns


# Page 268

The following table describes default user story state categories.
State
category
Description
Proposed
The first board column is automatically mapped to the default state for each
work item.
In Progress
Work flow state must be specified for each work item type and column.
Completed
Can only map to the last board column.
Removed
Workflow state doesn't need to be specified.
For more information, see About workflow and state categories.
 Tip
We recommend that you map each workflow state to a column. If it’s not mapped,
it doesn’t appear on the board.
ﾉ
Expand table


# Page 269

Do this task whenever you add columns, workflow states, or work item types (WITs). This
action is typically necessary when you change the Working with bugs setting, add WITs
to the Requirement category, or customize the workflow.
７ Note
When you add bugs or other work items to a board, it might create new workflow
states that require adjustments to column-to-state mappings in the following
situations:
When a team administrator shows bugs on backlogs and boards.
When a project administrator adds work item types to backlogs and boards.
When a project collection or project administrator customizes the workflow
for a work item type in the Requirement category using inherited process or
on-premises XML process.
Rename a column


# Page 270

Renaming your column titles to map to your workflow stages helps ensure clarity and
alignment within your team. It allows everyone to understand the current status of work
items at a glance and ensures that the board accurately reflects your team's workflow.
Rename a column directly from the board by selecting the column name, shown in the
following image. You can also rename a column from the column edit screen.
Each column represents a work stage, showing the number of items in progress. But,
there’s often a lag between moving work into a column and starting it. To address this
lag, enable split columns, which divide each column into "Doing" and "Done."
Split columns help your team implement a pull mechanism, providing visibility into idle
items and improving workflow transparency.
Split columns
７ Note
Before you split columns, ensure that each stage is mapped to a column.
Only split columns where clear hand-offs exist and you want teams to pull the
item into the next stage.


# Page 271

Choose the column tab that you want to split and add a check mark in the box to cause
the column to split.
With split columns enabled, update item statuses as usual. When you complete work on
an item, move it to Done instead of a downstream column. The next team member pulls
it into Doing and reassigns it to themselves when ready.
There are different column titles and choices based on the process used to
create your project and whether your team chose to treat bugs like
requirements or like tasks.
 Tip
You can filter queries and create charts using the Board Column Done field.
Move items into the Doing and Done columns


# Page 272

For example, after finishing a coding task, move it to Done under Develop. The tester
then pulls it into Doing under Test when ready to start testing.
Split columns provide greater insight into how many items sit idle in a Done column.
Your team can easily see when items pile up, signaling a potential bottleneck.
Review the frequency and location of pile-ups, so your team can adjust processes to
eliminate bottlenecks. Workflow processes with no or few bottlenecks correspond to
perfect flows.
You can query for work items in a split column using the Board Column Done field. This
field takes of a value of False when in the Doing column and True when in the Done
column.
Identify bottlenecks
List work items in a Doing or Done column


# Page 273

For examples on querying Board columns, see Query by assignment or workflow
changes.
When your team advances from one stage to the next, it's crucial they share a clear
understanding of "Done." Define the criteria for the Definition of Done in each column.
This action helps the team identify necessary tasks before advancing an item to the next
stage, implementing the core tenet of making processes and policies explicit.
Choose a column tab to configure the Definition of Done for that column.
Users can quickly double-check the criteria by choosing the Information tooltip 
 info
icon.
Add Definition of Done to a column


# Page 274

Removing or moving a column can help streamline your board and better reflect your
team's workflow and priorities. By adjusting the order of columns or removing
unnecessary stages, you can ensure that the most critical stages are prominently
displayed and that the workflow is intuitive for all team members.
1. Ensure the column doesn't contain any work items. If it does, move the items to
another column.
2. On the Configure board settings page, select Columns > Column options menu
 > X Remove.
Remove or move a column
Remove a column


# Page 275

To move a column, drag the column tab to the desired position on the board or in the
Column options menu, select Move left or Move right.
To update status, drag-and-drop your work items. For example, to signal when work can
start in a downstream stage, drag items to the next column. You can move an item from
one column to any other column on the board, forward and back.
To hand off work to another team member, reassign it directly from the board.
Move a column
Update status
Hand off work items


# Page 276

Users who receive the handoff can set alerts to get immediate email notifications of
their newly assigned work.
Use the query tool to list a subset of work items for review, triage, update, or chart
generation. For example, you can create a query to list all active user stories (specify two
clauses: Work Item Type=User Story  and State=Active ).
Specify work in progress (WIP) limits, split columns, and definition of done.
Drag an item up or down within a column.

Customize cards on a board
Article • 10/02/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
A board presents work items in the form of cards, where each card represents a work
item that facilitates information sharing, progress tracking, and task assignment. These
cards provide quick insights for you and your team. You can update a field on a card
without having to open the corresponding work item. You can also apply style rules to
highlight specific cards and tasks based on your set criteria.
Access levels: Have at least Basic access.
Permissions: To configure team settings, be part of the Project Administrators
security group or have the Team Administrator role. For more information, see
Change project-level permissions.
Tasks (optional): See the section, Card customization sequence
You can show fields on cards based on what your team frequently refers to or updates
when using the board. You can also add fields with information that you can use to filter
the board.
７ Note
This article addresses customization of a board. For information on customizing a
Taskboard, see Customize sprint Taskboards.
Prerequisites
Card customization options
７ Note
You can customize a work item type which is different than customizing the card
displayed on the board. You customize a work item type by adding fields, changing
the workflow, adding custom rules and more. You can also add custom work item
types and custom backlog levels. For more information, see Customize an
inheritance process.


# Page 279

Within the Settings dialog for a board, you have the following customization options.
Setting
Customization action
Fields
Add or remove fields from cards. Includes adding the Parent field to cards.

3. Meet with your team and determine which annotations should appear on cards
and how they want to configure inline tests.
If you're not a team admin, get added as one. Only team and project admins can
customize the board.
You can customize cards that appear on the board for your product backlog or portfolio
backlog such as features and epics. You follow similar steps, however you start from the
corresponding portfolio backlog.
1. Sign in to your organization ( https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization} ).
2. Open your board.
3. Choose the backlog level that you want to customize.
4. Choose the 
 gear icon to configure the board and set general team settings.
Open your board settings


# Page 281

You can edit a card field from the board, except for read-only fields like the Change By
and Changed Date. This quick update feature is useful when you need to update many
work items at once.
Do the following steps to update fields. To add a custom field, you must first add it to
the process used to customize the project.
1. From the board settings page, choose Fields and then choose a work item type to
see all the settings that you can modify. Your initial column settings appear similar
to the following image.
Your choices vary based on the process used to create your project and whether
your team has chosen to treat bugs like requirements or like tasks.
2. Add check mark in the box next to the fields that you want to appear on the board.
If you want work estimates to show, check Show Effort, which corresponds to the
following fields: Effort (Scrum), Story Points (Agile), and Size (CMMI).
3. To add a field, select the 
 plus icon and enter the name of a field you want to
add.
4. To remove a field, select the 
 delete icon next to the field.
Choose which fields appear on cards

5. When you're done, select Save.
With styling rules, you can cause cards to change color when their corresponding work
items meet criteria that you set. Here, we highlight severity 1 bugs by having the cards
display as yellow.
Which rules should you apply to highlight work items? Here are a few examples and
their associated criteria.
Work items
Criteria
High priority items
Priority = 1
High effort items
Effort 20  or Story Points 20
Stale items unchanged in the last 5 days
Changed Date @Today-5
７ Note
To show the Title of the parent work item, choose the Parent field. Choosing the
Parent title from a card opens the parent work item. To change the parent work
item, open the child work item and remove the link and add a different parent work
item. You can filter your board based on parent work items, whether the Parent
field is added to cards or not.

You can apply style rules to change the color of cards on boards and Taskboards.
1. From the board settings page, select Styles to specify a style rule.
2. Select + Add styling rule. Select the color to apply to the card and define the
criteria for the style rule.
In the following example, we show the Styles page for the Dashboard.
 Tip
Note the following information about style rules:


# Page 284

The criteria you specify works in a similar fashion as when constructing a query.
All clauses are considered AND clauses, grouping clauses isn't supported.
Card rules apply to all work items that meet the rule criteria.
Rule color applies to work items based on the order in which rules are listed. If you
add more than one style rule, make sure that you move them in the order of most
importance. Drag them into the order you want them applied.
You can quickly enable and disable a style rule.
In the following example, we add a Stale tasks rule, which highlights tasks that haven't
changed in the last five days.
3. To copy or delete a style rule, choose the 
 actions icon and select Clone or
Delete.
4. When you're done, select Save.
Before you set tag colors, add tags to backlog items that you want to highlight with
color.
1. From the Settings dialog, select Tag colors, and then + Add tag color. Then, select
the tag and the color you want to appear on the cards.
Assign tag colors

2. When you're done, select Save.
All applicable annotations for the selected board are enabled by default. These
annotations include all work item types added to the next level backlog, GitHub, and
Tests. Disable any unused annotations or ones that you want to restrict for a specific
backlog level.
When you disable an annotation, you also disable the feature to add the associated
object from the board. For example, if you disable the Tests annotation, you disable the
ability to add tests from the currently selected board.
Complete the following steps to manage annotations.
1. From your board settings page, select Annotations .

From a card on the board, you can go to the underlying test plan and test suite under
which the tests are created. Choose the 
 open icon to open another browser tab
showing Test and associated test plan and test suite that controls the inline tests.
 Tip
In a test plan, a test case can exist in multiple test suites. For example, you
may define several test suites for each product feature and the test cases test
scenarios across features. The test case might exist in both feature's test suite
with the same configurations and test steps. Because of this setup, the tester
might run the same test case multiple times for the same product version. To
avoid the redundancies that can occur under this scenario, you should choose
Show same outcome of the tests in multiple suites under the same plan
checkbox. When checked, the Test Points of the same Test Case and
configuration, shows the same latest outcome. When the tester runs any one
test, the output is synced with all other test points (which are of the same Test
Case work item and same configuration) in the Test Plans. The tester can use
the outcome and choose not to run the test again.

You can drag any work item to any column or swimlane on a board. You can even
change the order of items as you move a card to a new column.
In addition to the dynamic card reordering, you can also move a card to a specific
column position.
You can reorder the work items within a board column by choosing …Work items action
menu, selecting Move to position, and then specifying a value in the dialog.
Reorder cards
７ Note
The last column, typically the Closed or Done column, is always ordered by Closed
Date with the most recently closed items appearing towards the top of the column.
In all other columns, cards are ordered by the backlog order or they're reordered
based on the Card reordering setting selected.

Set Work in Progress limits
Article • 06/10/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Work-in-Progress (WIP) limits, a crucial Kanban practice, restrict the work your team
takes on at each stage. By emphasizing completion before starting new work, teams
often experience increased productivity and improved software quality.
Setting WIP limits for each stage adds soft constraints on the number of items allowed
in the corresponding columns. Exceeding these limits is possible, but your board
displays item counts next to each limit. Use this article as a guide for setting and
implementing WIP limits.
Access levels: Have at least Basic access.
Permissions: To configure team settings, be part of the Project Administrators
security group or have the Team Administrator role. For more information, see
Change project-level permissions.
Do the following actions to determine initial WIP limits.
Assess current work: Count the items present in your existing columns to set initial
WIP limits.
Set team-based limits: Set limits that don't exceed two or three items per team
member working within a stage. For instance, with three team members, the WIP
limit is six, three developers X two tasks/developer.
Start low: Begin with low limits to identify bottlenecks and address process issues
promptly.
After you set your WIP limits, track how well your team keeps within the limits.
Respecting WIP limits means teams don't pull items into a column if doing so causes the
number of items in the column to exceed the column limit. When they do, your board
Prerequisites
Determine initial WIP limits
Keep within WIP limits


# Page 294

provides immediate feedback. This feedback should act as a signal to the team to focus
immediately on activities to reduce the number of items in the column.
Although simple in theory, keeping within WIP limits can force individuals, teams, and
organizations out of their comfort zone. Team members who like to multitask might feel
constrained. Others might find themselves without work as they wait for work to
complete at an upstream stage.
To gain the advantages of constraining work-in-progress, have your team meet
frequently to discuss the process changes taking place.
To optimize the flow of value, you naturally want to identify and eliminate bottlenecks.
Bottlenecks indicate waste exists in the overall workflow process.
By monitoring your board over time, you can learn where bottlenecks occur. When
several items sit in a column unworked for several days, a bottleneck occurred.
Bottlenecks typically occur when WIP limits are too high. However, no bottlenecks could
indicate that WIP limits are too low.
Taking periodic snapshots of your board can visually catalog where work flows smoothly
and where bottlenecks appear.
Identify bottlenecks


# Page 295

Such snapshots can show your team the following information:
Average number of items within a workflow stage or column
The ratio of items being worked on to the number of team members within a
workflow stage or column
Number of items that stayed in a workflow stage or column for extended durations
Number of completed items and average throughput rate over a specific time
period
To address bottlenecks in your workflow process, it’s essential to identify the sources of
waste. Waste refers to anything not strictly necessary for achieving desired outcomes. In
software development, common forms of waste include:
Unused code or features
Defects requiring rework
Delays or waiting time
Handoffs between teams or processes
Insufficient requirements
Inefficient communication
Eliminate waste


# Page 296

To eliminate waste, engage in team discussions to identify causes and collaboratively
find acceptable solutions.
With an understanding of how you want to use WIP limits, do the following steps to set
them. Ensure you already mapped your team's work flow to columns.
1. Open your board.
2. Select the 
 gear icon to configure the board and set general team settings.
3. Choose Columns and then a column tab to set the WIP limit for that column.
Set WIP limits


# Page 297

4. When you're done, select Save.
Teams occasionally exceed WIP limits by one or two items. If you frequently exceed
limits by three or more items, review processes or adjust the limits.
Your team should engage in discussions after several weeks of using WIP limits. Identify
challenges, collaboratively decide on solutions, and adjust limits as needed. The
following list isn't exhaustive, but covers common challenges teams and proven
solutions.
Social dynamics: Team members might struggle with following rules. Some rebel,
others misunderstand applicability, and some take on extra work beyond agreed
limits. Multitasking beliefs can also hinder adherence.
７ Note
Different column titles and choices are available based on the process that
was used to create your project and whether your team has chosen to treat
bugs like requirements or like tasks.
WIP limits, challenges, and solutions
WIP challenges


# Page 298

Feedback
Variability of work: Uneven item sizes, for example, user stories and bugs, impact
workflow. Varying estimates, like hours, days, and story points, require tailored WIP
constraints.
Ignoring systemic issues: Teams often persist through bottlenecks instead of
tackling underlying workflow issues.
Culture change: Implementing WIP limits involves system, cultural, and team
adjustments.
Build a culture of team productivity: Address the tension between individual and
team productivity. Encourage practices that enhance overall workflow efficiency.
Size work appropriately: Discuss work size before starting tasks. Break down large
items into smaller tasks.
Prioritize high-value items: When idle, focus on moving upstream items forward.
Seek help when blocked or facing delivery challenges.
Resource team allocation: Ensure adequate specialists in each work stage to
prevent bottlenecks.
Build shared understanding: Foster team understanding of Kanban practices. Hold
regular retrospectives and document policies.
Make metrics-driven adjustments: Monitor WIP and lead time metrics for process
adjustments.
Manage culture change: Apply change management principles and promote team
ownership during WIP limit implementation.

Expedite work using swimlanes
Article • 10/03/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Your board helps you visualize the flow of work as it moves from defined to completed.
When you add swimlanes, you can also visualize the status of work that supports
different service-level classes. You can create a swimlane to represent any other
dimension that supports your tracking needs.
Access levels: Have at least Basic access.
Permissions: To configure team settings, be part of the Project Administrators
security group or have the Team Administrator role. For more information, see
Change project-level permissions.
You can use up to 50 swimlanes to sort work on your board and track items
differentiated by the following categories:
High priority items
Service-level class
Date-driven requirements
Dependencies for or from another team
Blocked items
Technical debt or other engineering work that isn't a specific user story
You can drag items into a swimlane and reorder them within the swimlane.
Prerequisites
Types of swimlanes
Track work in swimlanes
 Tip
Enter o  to expand all swimlanes and u  to collapse all swimlanes. To move the
focus up or down, enter the ↑↓ up/down arrows. For more information, see
Keyboard shortcuts.


# Page 301

You can also focus on a single swimlane by collapsing all other lanes.
When you have many swimlanes or cards on your board, you may encounter
slow performance when dragging a card. We recommend that you use
swimlanes in conjunction with card styles, tags, and board filters to manage
your work items. If you have a lot of cards in the default lane, place that lane
lower on the board to enhance performance when dragging a card to another
swimlane.
７ Note
The default lane appears unlabeled on the board. You can rename it, but you can't
delete it or apply rules to it.


# Page 302

Identify the swimlanes that support your tracking needs and add them to your board.
1. Open your board. If you're not a team admin, get added as one. Only team and
project administrators can customize the board.
2. Choose 
 Configure board settings to configure the board.
3. Choose Swimlanes, choose Add swimlane, and then enter the name of the
swimlane you want to add. For example, here we enter Expedite. You can optionally
select the more actions icon 
 to insert a new swimlane above or below another
swimlane.
） Important
Work items that appear on more than one team's board can yield results that don't
meet your expectations because each team can customize its board columns and
swimlanes. The values assigned to Board Column, Board Column Done, and Board
Lane fields might differ from what you expect when another team updates the
work item from a different board. For more information, see Add, review, and
update work items in Azure Boards.
Add or remove a swimlane
７ Note


# Page 303

4. To set the color of the swimlane, choose a color from the drop-down menu. To
reset the swimlane to the default, choose 
 Reset to default color.
5. To reorder a swimlane, choose the up or down menu selector 
 to move it up or
down. To remove a swimlane, choose 
 the trash bin icon, but first move all items
out of the lane.
The following images display the user interface with the New Boards Hub
feature enabled by default. For more information, see Manage or enable
features.

6. When you're done with your changes, choose Save.
Swimlane rules are similar to style rules but allow you to set conditions on your board to
automatically move work items into specific lanes. For example, you can set up a lane
for each person on your team. When you assign a work item, it gets placed into that
person's lane.
Swimlane rules are executed in order. Once a rule is met, it executes and moves on to
the next work item. For example, if Lane 1 has a rule that says "where priority = 1" and
Lane 2 has a rule that says "where priority = 2", a work item with priority = 1 gets moved
into Lane 1.
The following limits apply to swimlanes:
Up to five rules per lane
A maximum of 25 rules in total
Only AND  conditions are supported
Do the following steps to set up swimlane rules for your board.
1. From your board, choose the 
 gear icon to Configure board settings.
2. Select Swimlanes, select the swimlane or + Add swimlane, and then select + Add
criteria.
Set up swimlane rules
７ Note
Manual movement of items into these lanes is restricted to ensure consistency with
the configured rules. To move items into a swimlane with configured rules, ensure
that the items meet the criteria defined in the swimlane rules. Adjust the item
properties accordingly so that they automatically move into the correct swimlane.


# Page 305

3. Choose from the dropdown menus for each of the following entries: Field,
Operator, and Value, and then choose Save. For more information, see the
examples in the next section.
 Tip
You can't assign rules to the Default lane, but you can optionally rename it.


# Page 306

When your board refreshes, your work items are listed within the appropriate swimlane.
The following examples show some of the ways you can use and set up swimlane rules.
Track priority. We created rules for the Work Item Type  and Priority  fields, so
work items automatically go into the appropriate swimlane.

Show bugs on backlogs and boards
Article • 11/12/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
As your team identifies code defects or bugs, they can add them to the backlog and
track them similar to tracking requirements. You can schedule bugs to be fixed within a
sprint along with other tasks.
When you track bugs as requirements, they appear on the product Backlogs and boards.
When you track bugs as tasks, the bugs appear on Sprint Backlogs and Taskboards. For
more information about other work item types, see Add other work item types to
backlogs or boards.
You can define your team's tracking setting for the Agile, Scrum, and Capability Maturity
Model Integration (CMMI) processes. The Bug work item type isn't defined for the Basic
process, so there isn't a team setting for Basic. Instead, you should track bugs and code
defects using the Issue work item type.
Permissions: Be a team administrator or a member of the Project Administrators group.
The following table summarizes the options teams have for tracking bugs. Before you
make your choice, we recommend you review the information provided in Define,
capture, triage, and manage bugs, which provides an overview of the Bug work item
type and supported tools for managing bugs.
Option
７ Note
Requirements specify expectations of users for a software product. In Azure Boards,
requirements are defined by work items that appear on your product backlog.
Based on the process selected for your project, requirements correspond to User
Story (Agile), Product backlog item (Scrum), Issue (Basic), or Requirement (CMMI)
work item types. They also belong to the Requirements category, which manages
the work item types that appear on the product backlog.

View and configure a Cumulative Flow
Diagram
Article • 03/25/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
You use cumulative flow diagrams (CFD) to monitor the flow of work through a system.
There are two CFD charts: the in-context report you can view from a team backlog or
board and the CFD widget you can add to a dashboard.
CFDs help teams monitor the count of work items as they progressively move through
various workflow states. These diagrams can show the flow of epics, features, user
stories, issues, product backlog items, or requirements, depending on the process
selected for your project:
Agile
Basic
Scrum
Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)
Use this article to learn how to:
The CFD shows the count of items in each column for the selected time period. From
this chart, you can gain an idea of the amount of work in progress and lead time. Work
in progress counts unfinished requirements. Lead time indicates the amount of time it
takes to complete a requirement once work has started.
Configure the Cumulative Flow Diagram widget (Analytics)
＂
View and configure the CFD in-context report (Analytics)
＂


# Page 318

For the CFD to provide useful information, you'll want to update the status of work
items to reflect progress as it occurs. You can quickly make these updates through your
board.
For usage guidance, see Cumulative flow, lead time, and cycle time guidance.
You must be a member of a project. Get added to a project or create one.
To add a widget to a team dashboard, you need to be a member of the team. You
must have Basic access or greater, have dashboard permissions, or be a team
admin or project admin.
Boards must be enabled. If disabled, none of the work tracking Analytics widgets
display. To re-enable it, see Turn an Azure DevOps service on or off.
７ Note
The in-context report always uses the blue-green color theme. However, the
Analytics-based Cumulative flow diagram widget provides support for choosing
different color themes.

Lead Time and Cycle Time widgets
Article • 10/21/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
The Lead Time and Cycle Time widgets indicate how long it takes for work to flow
through your development pipeline. Lead time measures the total time elapsed from the
creation of work items to their completion. Cycle time measures the time it takes for
your team to complete work items once they begin actively working on them.
The following diagram illustrates how lead time differs from cycle time. Lead time is
calculated from Work Item Creation to entering a Completed state. Cycle time is
calculated from first entering an In Progress or Resolved state category to entering a
Completed state category. For more information, see About workflow states in backlogs
and boards.
These measures help teams plan, spot variations in efficiency, and identify potential
process issues. The lower the lead and cycle times, the faster the throughput your team
has. We recommend that your team check the lead time and cycle time charts before or
during each retrospective. Use lead time to help estimate delivery times and track
service level agreements (SLAs). Use cycle time to identify potential process issues, spot
variations in trends, and help with planning.
For more information, see Cumulative flow, lead time, and cycle time guidance.
Project membership:
You must be a member of a project. Get added to a project or create one.
Team membership and permissions:
To add a widget to a team dashboard, you need to be a member of the team.
Prerequisites


# Page 327

You must have Basic access or greater.
You need dashboard permissions, or be a team admin or project admin.
Feature enablement:
Boards must be enabled. If disabled, none of the work tracking Analytics
widgets display. To re-enable it, see Turn a service on or off.
Task awareness:
Be aware of the required and recommended tasks, listed later in this article.
1. Configure your team's board, if you haven't already.
Define the columns and swimlanes that support your workflow processes.
2. Add the widget to your dashboard. There are two widgets: Cycle Time and Lead
Time. Select the one you want to display and configure. For more information, see
Use
The Configuration dialog is the same for the Cycle Time and Lead Time widgets.
Configure these widgets for a team. For more information, see Create or add a team.
1. Select the 
 context menu icon and select Configure to open the configuration
dialog.
2. Modify the title, and then select the values you want to monitor:
Team
Work items
Swimlane
Field criteria
Time period
Add the widget to your dashboard
Configure the Cycle Time and Lead Time
widgets


# Page 328

To select a Swimlane, you must select Backlog.
７ Note
You can only select work item types that have been added to a backlog. To
add work item types to a backlog, see Customize your backlogs or boards


# Page 329

3. To further filter the work items used to calculate the lead or cycle time, specify the
Field Criteria. For example, all the work items whose Release field is set to
Milestone 1.
4. For a continuous flow, select Rolling period and specify the number of days you
want to view on the chart.
Or, for a fixed scope view, select and specify the Start date. Select this view if your
team employs a Scrumban process or follows a standard sprint process. The main
difference between these two types of charts is that the fixed scope chart provides
information of scope change in most cases.
5. Select Save when you're done. The following image shows an example Lead Time
chart showing 60 days of data.
(Inheritance process). For On-premises XML process, see Process
configuration XML element reference.
７ Note
Supplying no values to the filter might lead to selection of all work items, or
might be an invalid filter argument depending on type of filter criteria.


# Page 330

For your lead time and cycle time charts to provide useful data, your team must
quickly update the status of those work items that the widgets track.
Both Lead Time and Cycle Time widgets display as scatter-plot control charts. They
display summary information and provide several interactive elements.
Example Lead Time widget
Interpret the scatter-plot control charts


# Page 331

The chart dots represent completed work items, and their position on the horizontal axis
represents the date the team completed them. Their position on the vertical axis
represents the calculated lead time or cycle time.
Larger dots represent multiple work items with the same lead time or cycle time
Dot color corresponds to the work item type displayed in the legend
Dark gray dots correspond to a mix of work item types
Days on average (average lead time or cycle time) for the main work item types
configured for the chart. This number might not be equal to the average cycle time
or lead time of all work items. It depends on configurations you use for the
widgets. The average number is calculated based on each day the team takes time
for work item.
The number of backlog work items used in the chart calculations. If there are more
than three types of work items, you see a summary for Other.
The black trend line indicates the moving average.
The band around the trend line shows the standard deviation.
Summary elements
Interactive elements


# Page 332

Hover over any dot to see which work items contributed to the data point and the
lead time or cycle time for those items.
Select a dot to open the work item or query that lists the work items.
Filter the chart by selecting a work item type in the legend (
 , 
 , or other icon)
to filter on that type. To return to the original chart, refresh the dashboard.
The daily moving average value corresponds to the average of data points that fall
within the moving average window. The time-based moving average window is
calculated based on the current day and previous N days. N corresponds to 20% of
the number of days the chart displays, rounded down to the nearest odd number.
For example, if the chart displays the last 30 days, then N = five days. 20% of 30
days is six days rounded down to the nearest odd number, which is five.
The moving average window for April 10 corresponds to the previous five days. So,
the April 10 moving average is the average of all data points that fall on April 5
through April 10.
If you don't have data points that fall within the moving average window, the chart
doesn't show a moving average line. This scenario can occur if you're starting out
and there aren't enough days to calculate a moving average.
The standard deviation appears as a band that encompasses the moving average.
Standard deviation is calculated based on all data points falling within the same
moving average window. Like moving average, if no data points fall within the
moving average window, the chart doesn't plot standard deviation.

About work items and work item types
Article • 10/02/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Use work items to track features, requirements, code defects, bugs, and project issues or
risks. Each work item is based on a work item type that determines the fields available
for tracking information. The work item types available depend on the process used
when your project was created: Agile, Basic, Scrum, or CMMI.
Each work item represents an object stored in the work item data store and is assigned a
unique identifier within an organization or project collection.
If you're just getting started, read this article. To start tracking work on a board, see Plan
and track work. For a quick reference to various work item tasks and key concepts, see
Work item quick reference.
To track different types of work, choose a specific work item type. The following images
show the default work item types available for the four default processes. Items in your
backlog might be called User Stories (Agile), Issues (Basic), Product Backlog Items
(Scrum), or Requirements (CMMI). All four types are similar; they describe the customer
value of the work and provide fields to track information about that work.
The following image shows the hierarchy for the Agile process backlog work item:
User Stories and tasks are used to track work.
Bugs track code defects.
Epics and features are used to group work under larger scenarios.
Track work with different work item types
Agile process


# Page 335

Each team can configure how they manage Bug work items, at the same level as
User Story or Task work items, by configuring the Working with bugs setting. For
more information about using these work item types, see Agile process.
Each work item type belongs to a category. Categories are used to group work item
types and determine which types appear on backlogs and boards.

appear on any backlog or board.
For a list of other work item types, see Work item types to track testing, reviews, and
feedback later in this article.

Track bugs as requirements or tasks


# Page 336

Your team can choose how to track bugs. They can track them along with requirements,
showing them on the product backlog and board. Alternatively, they can track bugs
similar to tasks, typically linking them to a user story or product backlog item. A third
option is to not track them as requirements or tasks.
To configure the team bug tracking option, see Show bugs on backlogs and boards. For
an overview of all team settings, see Manage teams and configure team tools.
You can include or revise fields within a work item type, introduce a personalized work
item type, or adjust the display of work item types on backlogs and boards. The
approach and extent of customization available depend on the process model assigned
to your project. For more information, see the following articles:
Customize your work tracking experience
About process customization and inherited processes
Hosted XML process model.
The work item form displays the fields used to track information for each individual
work item. Define and update a work item through its respective form, as well as
through methods like bulk import, export, update, and modification.
Each work item form contains several tabs. The Details tab includes common fields,
other fields defined for the work item type, and the Discussion control. Common fields
for all work item types appear at the top of the form. These fields include Title, Assigned
To, State, Reason, Area, and Iteration. You can update these fields at any time.

Workflow states define how a work item progresses from creation to closure. They also
determine whether a work item appears on a backlog or board, as described in How
workflow category states are used in Azure Boards backlogs and boards.
The User Story (Agile process) has four main states that describe its progression: New,
Active, Resolved, Closed, and Removed. The following images illustrate the natural
progressions and regressions for User Stories (Agile), Issues (Basic), Product Backlog
Items (Scrum), and Requirements (CMMI). Similar progressions and regressions are
defined for other work item types in each process.
Workflow states: User Story, Agile process
Track active, open, resolved, or closed work items
Agile process
７ Note
A work item can exist in only one state at a time.
When all work is complete, set the work item State to Closed.
The board and Sprint Taskboard support viewing and updating the workflow
state of requirements or tasks using drag and drop. For more information, see
Start using your board and Update and monitor your Taskboard.


# Page 340

You can assign a work item to only one person at a time. The Assigned To field is an
identity field designed to hold a user identity added to the project. In the work item
form, select the Assigned To field to choose a project member, or start typing the name
of a project member to quickly narrow your search.
When configured with Microsoft Entra ID or Active Directory, Azure DevOps
synchronizes identity fields such as Activated By, Assigned To, Closed By, Created By,
Depending on the 
 View Options you select, work items in a Closed or
Completed state won't appear on the backlog.
The Removed state removes a work item from appearing on the backlog. For
more information, see Move, change, or delete work items.
You can query work items by State and other fields to list work in progress,
resolved, or completed. For more information, see Query by assignment or
workflow changes.

７ Note
You can assign a work item only to users who have been added to a project
or team.
You can assign a work item to only one user at a time. If work is split across
multiple users, create separate work items for each user responsible for the
work.
The drop-down menu of identity fields displays the names you have most
recently selected over time.
You can assign several work items at once from the backlog or query results.
See Bulk modify work items for details.

Manage Work Items in Azure DevOps
Article • 11/21/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 | Azure DevOps Server 2020
Visual Studio 2019 | Visual Studio 2022
Work items help you plan and manage your project by tracking different types of work,
such as user stories, product backlog items, tasks, test cases, or bugs. Use work items to
describe the work to be done, assign tasks, track status, and coordinate efforts within
your team.
This article describes the features that you can use to manage work items in Azure
DevOps.
Permissions:
To view, follow, and edit work items, have View work items in this node and
Edit work items in this node permissions set to Allow. By default, the
Contributors group has these permissions. For more information, see Set work
tracking permissions.
To add tags to work items, have the project-level Create new tag definition
permission set to Allow. By default, the Contributors group has this permission.
Access levels:
Be a project member.
To add new tags to work items or to view or follow pull requests, have at least
Basic access.
To view or follow work items, have at least Stakeholder access. For more
information, see About access levels.
All project members, including those in the Readers group, can send emails
containing work items.
７ Note
Provide Stakeholder access to members who want to contribute to the
discussion and review progress. These are typically members who don't
contribute to code, but want to view work items, backlogs, boards, and
dashboards.
By default, all Contributors and Stakeholders in public projects can add
new and existing tags. In private projects, Stakeholders can only add
existing tags. To control the ability to create new tags, set the Create tag


# Page 357

You can update a work item to change various elements, such as the title, description,
state, or assigned team member.
Once you select the work item you want to update, you can make changes to the
work item form.
You can view work items created by you or your team. The Work items page offers
several personalized pivots and interactive filter functions to streamline listing work
items.
You can also view work items from Visual Studio, Azure DevOps CLI, or the REST API.
For more information, see View and add work items.
Add links to work items to show relationships between them and other work items or
objects. In an Agile scenario, you would typically link features to epics, user stories to
features and tasks to user stories in parent-child relationships. There are many other link
types and objects you can link to your work items. For more information, see Link work
items to objects.
To track the progress of a single work item, select the Follow icon

You receive notifications when other project members modify the work item, such as
adding to the discussion, change a field value, or add an attachment.
You can specify the types of changes you want to be notified about. When you select
the settings icon, 
 you can select:
Not Subscribed: Only receive notifications from this work item when you're
@mentioned.
Subscribed: Receive notifications for all changes to this work item.
Custom: Specify notifications for:
State Changed: When the work item changes state
Assigned To Changed: When the work item is assigned to someone else
Iteration Changed: When the iteration path changes
Notifications are sent to your preferred email address, which you can change from your
user profile.
To stop following changes, select the Following icon 
 .
You can attach files to work items to provide more context or information. You can
attach up to 100 files to a work item. Each attachment is limited to 60 MB. You can
manage attachments through the web portal by selecting the attachment tab on your
work item.
For more information, see Manage attachments to work items.
Tags are keywords that you define to categorize work items. You can add tags to work
items to filter backlogs and queries.
To learn how to manage and use tags, see Add tags to work items.

Capture comments in the Discussion section


# Page 359

Use the Discussion section to add and review comments made about the work being
performed.
The rich text editor toolbar appears under the text entry area when you place your
cursor in any text box that supports text formatting.
Select one of the following icons to open a menu of recent entries where you
mentioned someone, linked to a work item, or linked to a pull request. Alternatively, you
can open the same menu by entering @ , # , or ! .
７ Note
A Discussion work item field doesn't exist. To query work items with comments
from the Discussion area, filter on the History field. The full content of the text
entered in the Discussion text box is added to the History field.
Mention someone, a group, work item, or pull request


# Page 360

Enter a name or number to filter the menu list to match your entry. Select the entry you
want to add. To bring a group into the discussion, enter @  followed by the group name,
such as a team or security group.
To edit or delete any of your discussion comments, choose 
 Edit or choose the 
actions icon and then choose Delete.
After you update the comment, select Update. To delete the comment, confirm that you
want to delete it. The History tab on the work item form maintains a full audit trail of all
edited and deleted comments.
Add one or more reactions to a comment by choosing a smiley icon at the upper-right
corner of any comment. Choose from the icons at the bottom of a comment next to any
existing reactions. To remove your reaction, choose the reaction on the bottom of your
comment. The following image shows an example of the experience of adding a
reaction, and the display of reactions on a comment.

If you only have permissions to add to the Discussion of a work item, then you can do
so by saving comments. This permission is controlled by Area Path nodes and the Edit
work item comments in this node permission. For more information, see Set work
tracking permissions, Create child nodes, modify work items under an area or iteration
path.
When you save the comments, you don't need to save the work item.
Cloning or copying a DevOps work item can be beneficial for several reasons:
Save a comment without saving the work item
７ Note
This feature is available starting in Azure DevOps Server 2022.1.
７ Note
When you save changes made to the Discussion control, only the comment gets
saved. No work item rules defined for the work item type are executed.
Copy or clone work items


# Page 362

Efficiency: Quickly create a new work item with similar details without manually
duplicating all the information.
Consistency: Ensure that the new work item retains the same structure, fields, and
values as the original, maintaining consistency across similar tasks.
Template Usage: Use an existing work item as a template for new work items,
especially for recurring tasks or standard processes.
Bulk Operations: Easily create multiple similar work items for different team
members or iterations.
Preserve History: Keep the history and context of the original work item while
creating a new instance for tracking separate progress.
For more information, see Copy or clone work items.
You can move work items from one team to another team within the same project. To
move work items, have the Edit work items in this node permission for the target team.
For more information, see Move work items from one team to another.
Project Work items can be customized to track additional information that is important
to your team. You can add custom fields, change the layout of the work item form, and
add custom rules to enforce processes. This customization can be done by modifying
the process templates used by your project.
There are two ways to customize work item templates:
1. Work Item Type: Customize the work item type used by your project. This
customization affects only the work item type. For more information, see Add and
manage work item types.
2. Work Item Template: Create custom work item templates used by your team
based on existing work items. Custom work item templates allow you to
prepopulate values in commonly used fields. For more information, see, Use work
item templates.
With the appropriate organization-level permissions, you can create customized
inherited process templates. All projects that use the customized process template get
the customizations made to that process. You can customize which work item types are
included in the process template and customize the work item template form. For more

information, see About process customization and inherited processes and Customize a
process template.
You can delete work items that are no longer needed. Deleted work items are moved to
the Recycle Bin where they can be restored or permanently deleted.
For more information, see, Remove, delete, or restore work items.
Analytics views provide a powerful way to visualize and analyze your work items. You
can use create custom reports and dashboards to track progress, identify trends, and
make data-driven decisions.
For more information, see What is Analytics?.

Interactively filter backlogs, boards,
queries, and plans in Azure Boards
Article • 11/22/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Filter functions in Azure Boards empower you to interactively apply one or more filters
to streamline your work item management. Each Azure Boards tool—such as Backlogs,
Boards, and Query results—comes prefiltered to display a relevant subset of work items
based on its specific functionality:
Backlogs and boards: Show work items based on the selected Area Paths and
Iteration Paths for your team.
Query results: List work items that match the query clauses you defined.
To enhance your filtering capabilities, enable the filter feature by selecting the 
 Filter
icon.
Even with these initial filters, you might still encounter a large number of work items.
Interactive filtering allows you to narrow down your view and focus on a specific subset
of work items by applying more filter criteria to each Azure Boards tool.
Filters can significantly enhance your workflow by helping you accomplish the following
tasks:
Daily scrum meetings: Focus the board on work assigned for a specific sprint to
facilitate effective stand-ups.
Sprints Taskboard: Filter to view a particular team member's completed work,
aiding in performance reviews and accountability.
Group work items: Concentrate on related work items by filtering based on Parent
Work Item, Area Path, or Tags, enhancing organization and clarity.
Triage work items: Create and apply queries to isolate similar work items grouped
by Area Path or Tags, enabling efficient issue resolution and backlog grooming.
Use cases for filters


# Page 381

By using these filter functions, your team can maintain focus, improve productivity, and
ensure that critical tasks receive the attention they deserve.
For more detailed information on using filters, see Filter Backlogs, Boards, and Plans.
Project access: Be a project member.
Filter functions are available from all Azure Boards tools: Work items, Boards, Backlogs,
Sprint Backlogs and Taskboards, Queries, and Delivery Plans. The set of features
supported depends on the tool and Azure DevOps version. (Use the content selector to
view the filters available for your version.)
The following table indicates the supported options based on the tool indicated with a
✔️ or is listed.
Backlogs and boards are subject to filters defined for the team as described in Set up
your Backlogs and Boards. Other tools have predefined filters based on the view, query
filter clauses, or settings you select.

Notes
1. While the Parent Work Item isn't a filter function for Backlogs or Query Results,
you can add the Parent field as a column and then do a keyword/phrase search on
the Parent title to effectively filter on parent work items. The Parent field is
supported for Azure DevOps Server 2020 and later versions. See also the Parent
field and Parent Work Item section later in this article.
2. The Parent Work Item filter is supported for Sprint Backlogs and Taskboards for
Azure DevOps Server 2020 and later versions.
Along with the standard filter functions summarized in the previous table, the following

Notes
1. The Work items page is subject to filters based on the view selected. Boards and
Backlogs are subject to filters defined for the team as described in Set up your
Backlogs and Boards. Completed and In Progress work items get determined
based on the state categories assigned to the workflow state as described in How
workflow states and state categories are used in Backlogs and Boards.
2. Grouping is supported through portfolio backlogs and boards, parent-child links,
and tree hierarchy. Tree hierarchies are flattened when filtering is applied and
reinstated when filtering is cleared.
3. Backlogs and Sprint Backlogs support reordering. However, when filtering is
enabled, reordering isn't supported.
4. Taskboards provides a Group by function based on People or Stories.
5. Query Results supports multi-column sort.
6. Work items appear in the order defined for the team Sprint backlog, which it
inherits from the team product backlog.
7. Semantic search supports sorting search results by the following fields—Assigned
To, Changed Date, Created Date, ID, State, Tags, Title, and Work Item Type—and
Relevance.
For more information about these other functions, see the following articles:
Reorder cards (boards)

# Page 387

The Parent Work Item filter enables you to focus on one or more select features or
epics. This filter function was added in July 2016 and made available in Azure DevOps
Server 2017 and later versions.
The Parent field was added to Azure Boards in July of 2019 and then made available
with the release of Azure DevOps Server 2020. You can add the Parent field to a list
through the Column Options dialog, except for the Work items tool. You can also add
the Parent field to cards on the boards and Taskboards.
Once you set filter options for a specific view, your settings persist until you modify
them. There's no need to select a save button or take any other actions.
To filter work items based on specific fields, first add the field as a column or to the card.
For example, to filter by Assigned To, Iteration Path, Work Item Type, or any other
field's content, ensure these fields are displayed on the cards, backlog, plan, or list.
All filter configurations are user-specific and remain active until you clear them.
To add columns or fields, see the following articles:
For Backlogs and Queries, see Change column options
For Boards, see Customize cards
For Taskboards, see Customize a sprint Taskboard
For Plans, see Review team delivery plans.
1. From the Azure Boards tool, choose the view you want. For example:
For Work items, select Assigned to me, Following, Mentioned, or other view.
For Backlogs and Boards, select the backlog level you want, such as Stories,
Features, or Epics.
For sprint Backlogs and Taskboards, choose the iteration
For queries, define the query filter criteria of interest.

3. For list views, add columns to display fields containing text you want to filter on or
possibly sort on. For card views, add fields to display on cards containing text you
want to filter on.
4. Select Filter 
 . Or, enter the Ctrl+Shift+f keyboard shortcut.
For example, here we open the filter toolbar for the board, Backlog items.
::: moniker-end
5. Choose your filters of interest.
The filter icon changes to a solid icon, Filter 
 , to indicate filtering is applied.
The page refreshes to show only those work items that meet all the selected filter
criteria.
When filtering is applied, the following functions are disabled or altered:
For backlogs, the add-a-backlog-item panel, reordering (stack ranking), and
forecasting tools are disabled.
For backlogs set to Show Parents, the tree hierarchy is flattened, unless you enable
the Keep hierarchy with filters from the View Options menu. See [Filter your
backlog and maintain the hierarchy](#keep hierarchy) provided later in this article.
To clear and dismiss filtering, choose Clear and dismiss filtering 
 .

Filters remain in place until you explicitly clear them. When you refresh your backlog,
board, or other tool, or sign in from another browser, filters remain set to your previous
values.
Once the board is filtered, you can choose the filter icon to hide the drop downs and
view the applied filters on the board. The filter icon turns opaque to signify a filtered
board.
You can filter your backlog and maintain the hierarchy of work by choosing show
Parents and Keep hierarchy with filters from the View Options menu. Use these options
when you want to show work items assigned to one or more team members, work item
types, area or iteration paths, or combination of these items and keywords. The
hierarchy is maintained and work items that match the filter criteria are shown in bold
text.
Filter your backlog and maintain the hierarchy


# Page 390

Applying Boolean operators to filters is only supported for tags, as described in Filter
based on tags later in this article. All other filters are applied with an implicit AND
operator.
The keyword filter allows you to search lists or cards based on the fields configured
through Column Options or board settings. You can filter by specific values, such as IDs
even if the ID field is visible. When using the keyword filter, ensure that the fields
containing the desired text or tags are displayed in your view.
The filter criteria ignore the following characters: ,  (comma), .  (period), /  (forward
slash), and \  (back slash).
Here we filter the board to only show those cards that include 'web' either in the title,
tag, or field.

# Page 391

Here we filter the Backlog with Show Parents enabled, to only show work items that
include 'web'.
The filtered set is always a flat list, even if you selected to show parents.
With filtering turned on, choose one or more values from the multi-select drop-down
menu for each field available to you. The values for these fields are populated as follows:
Area: The Node Name, which specifies the last node of an Area Path, of valid Area
Paths and for which there are work items assigned to that Area Path
Assigned To: All users who are currently assigned to work items on the board plus
Unassigned
Iteration: All Iteration Paths selected for the current team and for which there are
work items assigned to that iteration
Work item type: Work item types defined for the Requirements Category (product
backlog) or Features or Epic categories (feature or epic portfolio backlogs), subject
to work items being assigned to the work item types
Tags: All tags assigned to work items on the board
Parent Work Items: All features defined for the team, or all epics defined for the
team when viewing the Features board
Filter a backlog by using a keyword
Filter based on a field
７ Note


# Page 392

You can filter by select field values using the board for your product backlog (Stories,
Product Backlog Items, or Requirements) or a portfolio backlog (Features or Epics).
For example, here we filter for all items assigned to Jamal and Raisa.
Cards are filtered based on the assignments made in the following order and logic:
1. Assigned to: Show all cards that are assigned to user 1 OR  user 2 AND
2. Iteration: Show all cards that are assigned to Iteration 1 OR  Iteration 2 AND
3. Work Item type: Show all cards that are work item type 1 OR  work item type 2 AND
4. Tags: Show all cards that have tag 1 AND  or OR  tags 2, based on your selection of
AND | OR . AND
5. Parent Work Items: Show all cards that have Parent Work Item 1 OR  Parent Work
Item 2.
Filter options are dependent on the work items that meet the filter criteria. For
example, if you don't have any work items assigned to Sprint 4, then the Sprint 4
option won't appear in the filter options for the Iteration Path.
The values that populate the filter options are based on the work items that are
currently loaded and displayed. For example, if you have a backlog with 2,000 work
items, but only 1,000 are displayed on a board, the filter options are based on just
the items displayed.
Filter a board by using select field values
Board filter logic


# Page 393

Here we show a filtered backlog based on the keyword "issues." Filtered pages show the
 filtered icon. The filtered set is always a flat list, even if you selected to show a
hierarchical backlog view.
You can use the Filter by parent feature to filter by select parent work items using the
board for your product backlog (Stories, Product Backlog Items, or Requirements) or a
portfolio backlog (Features).
Use this feature only when you created features or epics and linked them to user stories
or features, respectively. A quick and easy way to create the links is to map them using
drag-and-drop. Mapping creates parent-child links between the work items.
To start filtering, choose Filter 
 . Choose one or more values from the multi-select
drop-down menu for the Parent Work Item. These values are derived from the Features
you defined.
Here, we choose two features on which to filter the board:
Filter a backlog by using fields
Filter based on the Parent Work Item
７ Note
The Filter by parent feature doesn't support filtering of parent work items of the
same work item type. For example, you can't filter the Stories backlog by specifying
user stories that are parents of nested user stories.


# Page 394

The final board displays just those stories linked as child work items to the selected
features.
If you added tags to your work items, you can filter your work using one or more tags.
For backlogs and query results, add Tags as a column option before filtering on tags.
Check the boxes of those tags that you want to filter on. Keep the OR selection to do a
logical OR for all the tags you selected. Or, choose the AND option to do a logical AND
on all the selected tags.
Filter based on tags


# Page 395

For more information about tags, see Add tags to work items to categorize and filter
lists and boards.
In addition to all the filter features described earlier in this article, you can also filter the
history view within a work item form.
To quickly find revisions made that contain a keyword, or made by specific people or to
a specific field, enable the filter feature by choosing 
 Toggle filter.

Manage requirements
Article • 10/11/2023
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
In this article, learn the key concepts and tasks associated with managing project
requirements with Agile tools and features in Azure DevOps.
Use work items to capture requirements. Each work item has a type, which depends on
the process you choose. You can also create a custom work item type.
Work items let you capture different information and workflows. Each work item has a
type, which depends on the process you choose. You can use these default work item
types for requirements and defects:
Agile: User Story and Bug
Basic: Issue and Bug
Scrum: Product Backlog Item and Bug
 Tip
Requirements management is a continuous process throughout a project lifecycle—
encompassing the processes of documenting, analyzing, prioritizing, tracking, and
collaborating with stakeholders to agree on work to be performed. A single
requirement corresponds to a capability which a project outcome—product, service,
architecture, performance—should conform.
Capture requirements
７ Note
Requirements specify expectations of users for a software product. In Azure Boards,
requirements are defined by work items that appear on your product backlog. They
correspond to User Story (Agile), Product backlog item (Scrum), Issue (Basic), or
Requirement (CMMI) work item types based on the process selected for your
project. They also belong to the Requirements category, which manages the work
item types that appear on the product backlog.
Work item types


# Page 398

CMMI: Requirement and Bug
You can customize each process for your Azure DevOps project. You can also decide
how to track bugs for each team.
Default work item types
The following image shows the hierarchy for the Agile process backlog work item:
User Stories and tasks are used to track work.
Bugs track code defects.
Epics and features are used to group work under larger scenarios.
Each team can configure how they manage Bug work items, at the same level as
User Story or Task work items, by configuring the Working with bugs setting. For
more information about using these work item types, see Agile process.
You can use custom work item types in the following ways:
Add custom fields and workflow states
Add custom rules to support business workflow processes
Add custom portfolio backlogs and customize backlogs and boards
Add custom controls to work item forms to gain enhanced functionality
Agile process
Customize work item types
Add work items to product backlog or board


# Page 399

Capture requirements by adding a Title to a product backlog and add the details later.
Capture requirements on the product backlog
Each work item supports tracking data contained in work item fields. Also, it captures
changes as updates occur within the History field and comments made in the
Discussion section. The following image shows a sample work item form for the User
Story work item type.
Use work items to support the following tasks:
Add information, update status, assign to team members, link work items, and
attach files
Assign work to a timebox or sprint
Quickly fill in work item fields using work item templates
Contribute to a queryable discussion thread
Prioritize work and triage work items.
Other features that support end-to-end traceability are the Development and
Deployment sections. These sections support the following tasks and insights:
Create a new branch or pull request from a work item
Complete the pull request
Perform a squash merge
Create a branch for several work items
Link a work item to existing development and build objects
View the release stages associated with the work item within the work item form in
real time
View the status of releases within those work items that are associated with
commits in the build and release pipelines
You can also use a .csv file or an Excel spreadsheet to import and update your
requirements. These tools let you work with a flat list or a tree of work items. For
Work item fields
Import and update requirements using Excel


# Page 400

example, you can define a tree of Epics, Features, and User Stories in Excel and then
import them to Azure DevOps, as shown in the following image.
Import requirements from Excel
Work items help you track any work that you or your team need to do. You can use the
same work item type for both functional and nonfunctional requirements. Functional
requirements describe what your product or service should do. Nonfunctional
requirements describe how your product or service should operate.
You can use tags, the Business Value field, or a custom field to categorize your
requirements.
Some requirements need more details than what you can put in the work item. You can
use Azure DevOps to store and manage your requirements in an Azure Repos
repository. Or, you can use a project wiki to keep your specifications in one place.
You can link or attach your specifications to your requirements.
Functional and nonfunctional requirements
Maintain requirement specifications


# Page 401

Prioritize and refine your backlog to make sure your requirements are clear and well-
defined. You can use these Azure Boards tools to help you with the following tasks:
Product backlog: Drag and drop work items to reorder them by priority and edit
multiple work items at once to change assignments or update fields. Query Results,
Triage mode: Review a list of work items and their forms to quickly update them and
add details.
Prioritize feature backlog
Group your requirements by features or business objectives using Azure Boards. You can
use portfolio work item types, portfolio backlogs and boards, and a Mapping tool to link
your requirements to a higher-level work item.
You can also use work item tags to group your requirements in different ways.
Use parent-child links to create a hierarchy of requirements, features, and epics - useful
for organizations with multiple teams that want to see how their work contributes to the
overall goals and use the portfolio planning tools.
With a hierarchy, you can manage a set of features that different teams work on. You
can also see the summary of estimates, progress, and more on the product backlogs.
Analyze and prioritize requirements
Group and organize requirements
Epics, features, and portfolio backlogs


# Page 402

Group user stories under Features using Mapping
Work item tags are labels that team members can add to work items. You can filter
backlogs and boards by these tags to see only the work items that match them. You can
also use tags in your queries. For example, you can see only the cards with the Web tag
on the board by filtering it with the web tag, as shown in the following image.
Filter backlogs and boards based on tags
Use tags to group work items
Implement Kanban or Scrum


# Page 403

Kanban and Scrum are two major Agile methods that Azure Boards supports. You can
also use a hybrid approach like Scrumban that combines elements of both methods.
Use a Kanban board to visualize your work items on a product or portfolio backlog. The
board shows the work items that belong to your team, based on the area and iteration
paths you choose.
You can customize your board to match your Kanban practices. For example, you can
define columns and swimlanes, set WIP limits, and specify the Definition of Done. You
can drag a work item to a different column to update its status as it moves through the
stages of your workflow.
Example board
Use a sprint backlog and a Taskboard to see the work items that your team has planned
for a specific sprint. You can assign work items to a sprint by dragging and dropping
them from your requirements backlog. Then, you can view them in a separate Sprint
Backlog.
Example sprint backlog
Implement Kanban
Implement Scrum


# Page 404

Use the following Scrum practices to plan and track your work:
Choose a sprint for your requirements
Break down your requirements into tasks
Set how much work each team member can do in a sprint
Adjust your work to fit your sprint capacity
Share your sprint plan with others
Filter, update, and change the status of your tasks
Monitor your sprint progress with a burndown chart
The Sprint burndown chart shows you how your sprint is going by updating the work
status every day, as you can see in the following image.
Example Sprint burndown chart

# Page 405

In Microsoft Project, you manage tasks that depend on the completion of other tasks by
linking them. To manage dependencies in Azure Boards, you can link work items using
the Predecessor/Successor link type. Once you've linked work items, you can view link
relationships using the Work Item Visualization
 Marketplace extension. The following
image illustrates link relationships among several work items.


Minimum Viable Product versus Critical Path
Management


# Page 406

Azure Boards doesn't have a built-in way to show the critical path because Agile
methods prefer a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) over Critical Path Management (CPM).
With MVP, you find the shortest and most dependent path by ranking epics, features,
stories, and tasks by importance.
You can use team velocity and forecasting to plan when you can deliver your work.
Working in sprints helps you understand your team’s velocity. Velocity shows how much
work your team can finish in a sprint, based on the number or the size of the completed
work items.
Example team Velocity chart
Use the Forecast tool to estimate Story Points, Effort, or Size for each requirement.
Perform milestone planning
Team velocity
Forecast requirements


# Page 407

You can also set team velocity based on your estimates. For example, if you say your
team can do 12 Story Points per sprint, the Forecast tool shows you which requirements
and features you can finish in the next six sprints. You can use the Planning tool to
assign requirements to the predicted sprints.
Example Forecast of requirements backlog
[
]
Use a Marketplace extension to integrate your requirements planning with Microsoft
Project tools.
Milestone markers aren't used in Azure Boards work tracking, except for Delivery Plans.
Delivery Plans provide a calendar view and allow you to define a milestone marker.
You can use one or more of the following options to mark a work item as a milestone:
Prepend or append the word Milestone in the title of your work item
Add a work item tag labeled Milestone
Add a custom field labeled Milestone and populate it with a pick list of milestones
Link work items using the Predecessor/Successor or Related link type to a
milestone work item
Assign a milestone work item to the sprint in which it's targeted for completion.
Milestone markers
Assign requirements to timeboxes


# Page 408

You can quickly assign work items to a sprint through drag-and-drop from the product
backlog to the sprint listed within the Planning pane.
Example assign requirements to sprints
To review progress and deliverables, you can use the following tools:
Features board: Shows the status of each feature and its tasks
Features backlog: Displays the rollup columns for the features and their child work
items
Delivery plans: Provides a timeline view of the features and their dependencies
across different teams
You can also use your Features board to track progress and ensure the continuous
delivery of value. The following image shows an example of a customized Features
board. It has added columns for different stages of feature development, such as Need
more info, Spec Complete, In Progress, and Customer Rollout. These columns reflect the
natural flow of features from proposal to production.
Example of Features board with customized columns

Monitor and report on progress
Features board


# Page 409

The Features backlog offers a quick and visual way to monitor progress. You can add
the rollup progress bar column to see the completion percentage of each feature’s
work items. The following image shows how the column shows the progress of different
features.
Example of Requirements backlog showing progress rollup
If you want to see the features that several teams are delivering across a timeline, you
can set up a delivery plan. A delivery plan is an interactive board that shows a calendar
view of the stories or features that different teams plan to deliver.

Define, capture, triage, and manage
software bugs in Azure Boards
Article • 10/18/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
How do you track and manage defects in your code? How do you make sure software
problems and customer feedback get addressed quickly to support high-quality
software deployments? How do you make good progress on new features and address
your technical debt?
At a minimum, you need a way to capture your software issues, prioritize them, assign
them to a team member, and track progress. You want to manage your code defects in
ways that align with your Agile practices.
To support these scenarios, Azure Boards provides a specific work item type to track
code defects named Bug. Bug work items share all the standard features of other work
item types with a few more. For an overview of standard features, see About work items
and work item types.
Bugs also provide the following features:
Options for each team to choose how they want to track bugs
Test tools to capture bugs
Built-in integration across Azure DevOps to track bugs linked to builds, releases,
and tests
Project access: Be a project member.
Permissions:
Have View work items in this node and Edit work items in this node
permissions set to Allow. By default, the Contributors group has these
７ Note
Bug work item types aren't available with the Basic process. The Basic process
tracks bugs as Issues and is available when you create a new project from Azure
DevOps Services or Azure DevOps Server 2019.1
 or later versions.
Prerequisites


# Page 412

permissions. For more information, see Set work tracking permissions.
To add new tags to work items, have at least Basic access and the project-level
Create new tag definition permission set to Allow. By default, the Contributors
group has this permission.
Email work items: All project members, including those in the Readers group, can
send emails containing work items.
The following image shows the Bug work item type for the Scrum process. The Bug work
item type for Agile and Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) processes tracks
similar information. It appears on the product backlog along with requirements or on
the Taskboard along with tasks.
７ Note
Stakeholders can't add new tags, even if the permission is explicitly set,
due to their access level. For more information, see Stakeholder access
quick reference.
 Tip
To report a bug, a user must have at a minimum, Stakeholder access. A user must
have Edit work items in this node permission set to Allow for the Area Path where
they add the bug. For more information, see Set work tracking permissions
Bug work item type
７ Note
The images you see from your web portal might differ from the images you see in
this article. These differences result from updates made to your web app, options
that you or your administrator enabled, and which process was chosen when
creating your project: Agile, Basic, Scrum, or CMMI. The Basic process is available
with Azure DevOps Server 2019 Update 1
 and later versions.


# Page 413

The Bug work item type uses some bug-specific fields. To capture both the initial issue
and ongoing discoveries, use the fields described in the following table. For information
about fields specific to the Bug defined for the Capability Maturity Model Integration
(CMMI) process, see Bugs, issues, and risks field reference. For information about all
other fields, see Work item field index.
Field, Group, or Tab
Usage
Steps to Reproduce (friendly name=Repro Steps)
Use to capture enough information so that other team members can fully understand
the code defect. Include actions taken to find or reproduce the bug and expected
behavior.

Fields specific to bugs


# Page 414

System Info Found In Build
Information about the software and system configuration that is relevant to the bug and
tests to apply. The System Info and Found in Build fields are automatically filled in
when you create a bug through a testing tool. These fields specify information about the
software environment and build where the bug occurred. For more information, see Test
different configurations.
Acceptance Criteria
Provide the criteria to meet before the bug can be closed. Before work begins, describe
the customer acceptance criteria as clearly as possible. Teams should use this criteria as
the basis for acceptance tests and to evaluate whether an item is satisfactorily
completed.
Integrated in Build
Specifies the name of the build that incorporates the code that fixes the bug. This field
should be specified when you resolve the bug.
For on-premises Azure DevOps, to access a dropdown menu of all builds that have run,
you can update the FIELD  definitions for Found in Build and Integrated in Build to
reference a global list. The global list is automatically updated with each build that is
run. For more information, see Query based on build and test integration fields.
For information about how to define build numbers, see Classic pipelines configuration.
Priority
1: Product requires successful resolution of the work item before it ships and
addressed soon.
2: Product requires successful resolution of the work item before it ships, but
doesn't need to be addressed immediately.
3: Resolution of the work item is optional, based on resources, time, and risk.
Severity
1
1


# Page 415

A subjective rating of the impact of a bug or work item on the project or software
system. For example: If a remote link within the user interface (a rare event) causes an
application or web page to crash (a severe customer experience), you might specify
Severity = 2 - High and Priority = 3. Allowed values and suggested guidelines are:
1 - Critical: Must fix. A defect that causes termination of one or more system
components or the complete system, or causes extensive data corruption. There
are no acceptable alternative methods to achieve required results.
2 - High: Consider fix. A defect that causes termination of one or more system
components or the complete system, or causes extensive data corruption. An
acceptable alternative method exists to achieve required results.
3 - Medium: (Default) A defect that causes the system to produce incorrect,
incomplete, or inconsistent results.
4 - Low: A minor or cosmetic defect that has acceptable workarounds to achieve
required results.
Deployment
The Deployment control supports links to and display of releases that contain work
items. To use the control, you must enable settings for the release. For more
information, see Link work items to releases later in this article.
Development
The Development control supports links to and display of links made to development
objects. These objects include Git commits and pull requests, or TFVC changesets and
versioned items. You can define links from the work item or from the commits, pull
requests, or other development objects. For more information, see Link work items to
development later in this article.
 To change the menu selection or picklist, see Customize the work tracking experience.
The customization method depends on the process model used by your project.
Notes
1
Choose how your team tracks bugs


# Page 416

Your team can track bugs as requirements or as tasks. To support the team choice,
consider the following factors.
Size of your team. Smaller teams can maintain a lightweight footprint by tracking
bugs as requirements.
Organization requirements to track work. If your team is required to track hours,
then choose to track bugs as tasks.
Organization of your team's work. If your team relies on the product backlog to
prioritize work and add bugs, track bugs as requirements.
Tools your team wants to use such as the Planning pane, velocity chart, forecast,
rollup, and delivery plans. Tracking bugs as tasks prevents use of several of these
tools.
The following table summarizes the three options teams have to track bugs. To learn
more and to set the option for your team, see Show bugs on backlogs and boards.
Option
Choose when you want to...
Track bugs as Requirements
Prioritize, or stack rank, bugs along with requirements
Estimate Bug effort for forecasting
Update bug status on board
Include Bugs in Velocity charts and Cumulative Flow Diagrams
Be able to use the Forecast tool to support sprint planning
Drag bugs to the Planning pane to assign bugs to a sprint
View Bugs on Delivery Plans
Track bugs as Tasks
Estimate work for bugs similar to tasks
Update bug status on sprint Taskboards
Link bugs to requirements as child items
７ Note
Bugs are assigned to the Requirements Category


# Page 417

Drag bugs to the Planning pane to assign bugs to a sprint
Bugs don't appear on backlogs or boards
Manage bugs using queries
You can customize the Bug and other work item types. Or, create custom types to track
software issues or customer feedback. For all work item types, you can customize the
following elements:
Add or remove custom fields
Add custom controls or custom tabs within the work item form
Customize the workflow states
Add conditional rules
Choose the backlog level in which work items appear
Before you customize your process, we recommend that you review About configuring
and customizing Azure Boards.
To customize your particular process, see Customize an inheritance process.
７ Note
Bugs are assigned to the Task Category
User Stories (Agile), Product Backlog Items (Scrum), or Requirements (CMMI)
are the natural parent work item type for Bugs
Bugs aren't visible on Delivery Plans

You can define bugs from several different Azure DevOps tools. These tools include
backlogs and boards and testing tools.
If your team chose to manage bugs with requirements, you can define bugs from your
product backlog or board. For more information, see Create your product backlog or
Use your board.
Add a bug from the product backlog
Add a bug from the board
Add or capture bugs
 Tip
By default, the Title field is the only required field when you create a bug. You can
add bugs in the same way you add user stories or product backlog items using
Azure Boards. You can make some fields required by adding conditional rules
based on a state change. For more information, see Add a rule to a work item
type.
Add a bug from your backlog or board
 Tip
When you add a bug from your product backlog or board, the bug is automatically
assigned the default Area Path and Iteration Path defined for the team. For more


# Page 419

If your team chose to manage bugs with tasks, you can define bugs from your board,
product backlog, Sprint backlog, or Sprint Taskboard. You add a bug as a child to a
product backlog work item.
Add a linked child bug from the Sprint Backlog
You add a bug in the same way you add a task to a Sprint backlog. For more
information, see Add tasks to backlog items.
Add a linked child bug from the board
You add a bug in the same way you add a task to a backlog item. For more
information, see Add tasks or child items as checklists.
information, see Team defaults referenced by backlogs and boards.
Add a bug from your sprint backlog or Taskboard


# Page 420

The two testing tools you can use to add bugs while testing include the web portal Test
Runner and the Test & Feedback extension.
Test Runner: When running manual tests, you can choose to Create bug. For more
information, see Run manual tests.
Test & Feedback extension: When running exploratory tests, you can choose to
Create bug or Create task. For more information, see Exploratory testing with the
Test & Feedback extension.
As with all other work item types, the Bug work item type has a well-defined workflow.
Each workflow consists of three or more States and a Reason. Reasons specify why the
item transitioned from one State to another. The following images illustrate the default
bug workflow defined for the Agile, Scrum, and CMMI processes.
Create a bug from a testing tool
Bug lifecycle and workflow states
ﾉ
Expand table


# Page 421

Agile
Scrum
CMMI
For Scrum bugs, you change the State from Committed (similar to Active) to Done. For
Agile and CMMI, you first resolve the bug and select a reason that indicates the bug is
fixed. Typically, the person who created the bug then verifies the fix and updates the
State from Resolved to Closed. If you find more work after you resolve or close a bug,
reactivate it by setting the State to Committed or Active.
To verify a fix, a developer or tester attempts to reproduce the bug and look for more
unexpected behavior. If necessary, they should reactivate the bug.
When verifying a bug fix, you might find that the bug wasn't fixed or you might disagree
with the resolution. In this case, discuss the bug with the person who resolved it, come
to an agreement, and possibly reactivate the bug. If you reactivate a bug, include the
reasons for reactivating the bug in the bug description.
７ Note
The Agile process bug work item type previously had a rule which reassigned the
bug to the person who created it. This rule has been removed from the default
system process. You can reinstate this automation by adding a rule. For an
Inheritance process, see Automate reassignment based on state change.
Verify a fix
Close a bug


# Page 422

You close a bug when a team member verifies it as fixed. However, you might also close
a bug for one of the following reasons. Reasons available depend on the project process
and the bug transition states.
Agile process:
Deferred: Defer bug fix until the next product release.
Fixed: Bug is verified as fixed.
Duplicate: Bug tracks another bug currently defined. You can link each bug with
the Duplicate/Duplicate of link type and close one of the bugs.
As Designed: Feature works as designed.
Cannot Reproduce: Tests prove that the bug can't be reproduced.
Obsolete: The bug's feature is no longer in the product.
Copied to Backlog: A user story has been opened to track the bug.
Scrum process:
Not a Bug: Bug is verified that it isn't a bug.
Duplicate: Bug tracks another bug currently defined. You can link each bug with
the Duplicate/Duplicate of link type and close one of the bugs.
Removed from the backlog: Bug is verified that it isn't a bug. Remove the bug
from the backlog.
Work finished: Bug has been verified as fixed.
CMMI process:
Deferred: Defer bug fix until the next product release.
Duplicate: Bug tracks another bug currently defined. You can link each bug with
the Duplicate/Duplicate of link type and close one of the bugs.
Rejected: Bug is verified that it isn't a bug.
Verified: Bug is verified as fixed.
It's always a good idea to describe any more details for closing a bug in the Discussion
field to avoid future confusion as to why the bug was closed.
 Tip
After a bug has been closed and the fix is actively released in deployments,
recommended practice is to never reopen it due to regression. Instead, you should
consider opening a new bug and link to the older, closed bug.
Automate bug closure when merging pull requests


# Page 423

If your team uses a Git repository, you can set the State in linked bugs and other work
items to close upon successful merging of pull requests. For more information, see Set
work item state in pull request later in this article.
Most teams, whatever option they chose to track bugs, define one or more bug queries.
With queries, you can list active bugs, unassigned bugs, stale bugs, bug trends, and
more. You can add queries and query charts to your team dashboards to monitor bug
status and progress.
Open a shared query or use the query editor to create useful bug queries, such as the
following options:
Active bugs by priority ( State <> Done  or State <> Closed )
In Progress bugs ( State = Committed  or State = Active )
Bugs to fix for a target release ( Tags Contains RTM )
Recent bugs, such as bugs opened in the last three weeks ( Created Date > @Today-
21 )
When you have the queries of interest to your team, you can create status or trend
charts. You can also add the chart you create to a dashboard.
After you start coding and testing, hold periodic triage meetings to review and rank
your bugs. Typically, the project owner runs the bug triage meetings. Team leads,
business analysts, and other stakeholders who can speak about specific project risks
attend the triage meetings.
The project owner can define a shared query for new and reopened bugs to list bugs to
be triaged.
From the query results page, you can move up and down within the list of bug work
items using the up and down arrows. As you review each bug, you can assign it, add
details, or set priority.
List and triage bugs
Bug queries
Triage mode in query results


# Page 424

If your team tracks bugs as requirements, view the list of active bugs from your backlog.
With the filter function, you can focus solely on bugs. From the product backlog, you
can also do the following tasks:
Organize bugs on your backlog. Stack rank against other items. Stack ranking is
disabled when filtering is enabled.
Assign bugs to a sprint from your backlog using the Planning pane.
Map Parent bugs to Features or other portfolio backlog items using the Mapping
pane.
View rollup of work to portfolio backlog items.
If your team tracks bugs as tasks, use managed queries to list and triage bugs. In each
sprint, you see the bugs assigned to the sprint from the Sprint backlog or Taskboard.
You might notice and wonder why the items shown on a sprint Taskboard can differ
from a query list created in a corresponding sprint backlog.
It's possible to assign tasks or bugs to an iteration but not link them to a parent backlog
item. These items appear in the created query, but might not show up on the Taskboard
itself. The system runs the query and then applies a few background processes before
displaying Taskboard items.
These reasons can cause work items that belong to the Task Category to not appear on
a sprint backlog or Taskboard:
Organize and assign bugs to a sprint
Taskboard items versus query list items


# Page 425

The task or bug isn't linked to a parent backlog item. Only bugs and tasks are
linked to a parent product backlog item (Scrum), user story (Agile), or requirement
(CMMI) with an iteration path set to the sprint appears on the sprint backlog page.
The task or bug is a parent of another task or bug, or the user story is a parent of
another user story. If you create a hierarchy of tasks, bugs, or user stories, only the
child-level tasks or the child-level stories at the bottom of the hierarchy appear.
For more information, see Troubleshoot reordering and nesting issues.
The task's or bug's linked parent corresponds to a backlog item defined for
another team. Or, the area path of the task's or bug's parent backlog item differs
from the task's or bug's area path.
When your team tracks bugs as requirements, you can use the board to add tests to
verify bug fixes.
You can update the bug status by dragging and dropping bugs to a new column on a
board.
If your team tracks bugs as requirements, you use the board as shown in the
following image. For more information, see Update work item status.
Create inline tests linked to bugs
Update bug status


# Page 426

If your team tracks bugs as tasks, you use the Taskboard. For more information, see
Update and monitor your Taskboard.
You can add intermediate columns to track your bug status on the board. You can also
define queries that filter based on the status of a Board Column. For more information,
see the following articles:
Add columns to your board
Customize a sprint Taskboard
Query changes to a board
To automate select actions, add custom rules to your Bug work item type. For example,
add a rule as shown in the following image. This rule specifies to reassign a bug to the
person who opened the bug when a team member resolves it. Typically, that person
verifies that the bug is fixed and closes the bug. For more information, see Apply rules
to workflow states (Inheritance process).

Customize your board to track intermediate states
Automate bug reassignment based on workflow state


# Page 427

When you create a pull request, you can set the state value of the linked work items in
the description. Follow the syntax: {state value}: #ID .
When you merge the pull request, the system reads the description and updates the
work item state. The following example sets work items #300 and #301 to Resolved, and
#323 and #324 to Closed.

One of the methods used by Azure DevOps to support integration is to link objects to
other objects. Along with linking work items to work items, you can also link work items
to other objects. Link to objects such as builds, releases, branches, commits, and pull
requests as illustrated in the following image.
You can add a link from the work item or from the build and release objects.
The Development control supports linking to and displaying links made to builds, Git
commits, and pull requests. When a TFVC repository is used, it supports links to
changesets and versioned items. Choosing the link opens the corresponding item in a
new browser tab. For more information, see Drive Git development from a work item.
Integration across Azure DevOps
Link work items to development


# Page 429

The Deployment control supports links to and display of releases that contain the work
items. For example, the following image shows several releases that contain links to the
current work item. You can expand each release to see details about each stage. You can
choose the link for each release and stage to open the corresponding release or stage.
For more information, see Link work items to deployments.
Link work items to releases


# Page 430

Pipelines are often defined to automatically run when a new commit occurs to a Git
repository. Work items associated with the commit pipelines appear as part of the
pipeline run if you customize your pipeline settings. For more information, see
Customize your pipeline.
Link work items to pipeline runs


# Page 431

If you use classic pipelines (not YAML), you can create work items on a build failure. For
more information, see Create a work item on failure.
You can track the bug status, assignments, and trends using queries that you can chart
and add to a dashboard. For example, here are two examples showing active bug trends
by State and Active Bugs by Priority over time.
Create or edit a work item upon a build failure
Monitor bug status, assignments, and trends


# Page 432

For more information about queries, charts, and dashboards see managed queries,
charts, and dashboards.
The Analytics service is the reporting platform for Azure DevOps. It replaces the previous
platform based on SQL Server Reporting Services.
Analytics views provide prebuilt filters to view work items. Four Analytic views are
supported for bug reporting. You can use these views as defined or further edit them to
create a custom, filtered view.
Bugs - All history by month
Bugs - Last 26 weeks
Bugs - Last 30 days
Bugs - Today
For more information about using Analytic views, see About Analytics views and Create
an active bugs report in Power BI based on a custom Analytics view.
You can use Power BI to create more complex reports than a query. For more
information, see Connect with Power BI Data Connector.
There are multiple bug-related Marketplace extensions. See Marketplace for Azure
DevOps

Manage issues or impediments in Azure
Boards
Article • 06/10/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
If you have known issues you want to track, you can do so by defining an impediment
(Scrum) or issue (Agile or CMMI). Impediments and issues represent unplanned
activities. Resolving them requires more work beyond what's tracked for actual
requirements. Use the impediment work item type to help you track and manage these
issues until you can resolve and close them.
Don't confuse impediments with bugs. You track impediments that may cause problems
with delivering one or more requirements. For example, you may have to fix feature
ambiguity, personnel or resource issues, problems with environments, or other risks that
influence scope, quality, or schedule. Other issues that deserve tracking are decisions
that require several stakeholders or product teams to weigh in on.
In this article you'll learn:
Project access: Be a project member.
Permissions:
） Important
Issues and Impediments discussed in this article are defined for projects created
with the Agile, Scrum, or CMMI process. By default, these work item types don't
appear on the product backlog or taskboard.
If your project was created using the Basic process, which tracks work using Epics,
Issues, and Tasks, then you track Issues using the product backlog. For more
information, see Track issues and tasks.

permissions set to Allow. By default, the Contributors group has these
permissions. For more information, see Set work tracking permissions.
To add new tags to work items, have at least Basic access and the project-level
Create new tag definition permission set to Allow. By default, the Contributors
group has this permission.
Email work items: All project members, including those in the Readers group, can
send emails containing work items.
You use issues or impediments to track items that may block work from getting done. In
general, you link these items to user stories or other work items using a Related link
type.
Define tasks when you want to create a checklist of tasks. You can also define tasks if
you use Scrum methods and track work using the Remaining Work field. By linking
requirement work item types to tasks using the Parent-Child link type, the tasks appear
on the taskboard for each linked user story.
Open Boards>Work Items, and choose the 
 plus icon, and then select from the New
work item menu of options.
７ Note
Stakeholders can't add new tags, even if the permission is explicitly set,
due to their access level. For more information, see Stakeholder access
quick reference.
７ Note
The images you see from your web portal might differ from the images you see in
this article. These differences result from updates made to your web app, options
that you or your administrator enabled, and which process was chosen when
creating your project: Agile, Basic, Scrum, or CMMI. The Basic process is available
with Azure DevOps Server 2019 Update 1
 and later versions.

Link work items to objects
Article • 01/07/2025
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Work item links are associations between two work items or a work item and another
object. Links describe the relationship between objects. You can use work item links to
track dependencies and related work for traceability, share information, manage
complex projects that involve multiple teams or products, track code changes, tests, and
more.

Link work items to various objects


# Page 441

To link work items to various objects, follow these general steps:
1. Sign in to your organization ( https://dev.azure.com/{Your_Organization} ).
2. Open the existing work item that you want to link from, or create a new one.
3. Select Links > Add link, and then select Existing item or New item.
4. In the Link type dropdown list, select the link type that you want to create.
5. In the field that follows, enter or select the object that you want to link to.
6. (Optional) Enter a comment to describe the link.
7. Select Add link to create the link.
For more specific instructions on linking different types of work items, refer to the
sections that follow.
 Tip
You can use other features to link or change links that use the Parent/Child link
type. Some features are version-dependent. For more information, see the
following articles:
To link backlog items to portfolio backlog items or change the link structure,
use the mapping pane to organize your backlog. You can also choose to
Show Parents and drag-and-drop items within the tree hierarchy.
To create and link tasks to backlog items, use the sprint backlog page. You
can also drag-and-drop items to change the link structure from the web
portal.
To indent, outdent, and change the link structure of a tree hierarchy, reparent
and reorder items from a backlog in the web portal or use a tree query in
Team Explorer.


# Page 442

To add a link to another work item in the web portal, do the following steps:
1. Open the work item that you want to link from.
2. In the work item form, you can choose from two ways to do this task:
Go to the Related Work section and select Add link > Existing item.
Select Links > Add link > Existing item.
3. In the Link type dropdown list, select the link type that you want to create, for
example, Child, Parent, or Related.
4. In the Work items to link field, enter the ID of the work item you want to link to, or
select from the dropdown menu, and then select Add link.
The following example uses the Related link type to a test case with ID of 280.

Do the following steps to link work items to objects defined in other Azure DevOps
organizations. You can only do so if both organizations use the same Microsoft Entra ID
to manage users.
1. From your work item, select Links > Add link > Existing item.
2. Choose one of the following remote link types from the Link type dropdown
menu:
Consumes From or Produces For: When you want to track dependencies of
work items that are defined in different organizations and managed by
different teams.
Remote Related: When the work items being linked are defined in different
organizations and managed by different teams, but don't have strong inter-
dependencies.
3. Enter the URL of the remote work item, and then select Add link.
The following example uses the Remote Related link type to link to work item ID
350 that exists in the remotelinkingtest2 organization, RemoteLinking project.
Link work items to remote work items (cross-
organization)

3. Choose the parameters to filter your search of builds.
To link to a build in a different project, first choose the Project whose build you
want to link to.
For example, you can specify a build number, select a build pipeline, or a build
result, such as, All, succeeded, partially succeeded, failed, or canceled. Or, with
Succeeded selected for Result, select Find builds to list the available builds you
can link to.


# Page 453

4. Choose the build from the list you want to link to and then select Confirm.
5. Select Add link to complete the operation.


# Page 454

As you develop your software, you can capture which code changes and builds support
the completion of a work item. Your team can understand what work was done or how a
bug was fixed through the audit trail of changes to the code base.
The link types used to construct these links are: Branch, Build, Changeset, Commit,
Found in build, Integrated in build, Pull Request, Versioned Item, and Integrated in
release environment. These types appear in the following image.
Link work items to deployments


# Page 455

 Tip
Drive development from the work item when you create it. You can also add the
work item ID when creating branches, commits, and pull requests. Git lets you link
work items to commits using the Commit link type. Here are the ways to do it:
Before committing your changes, add work item IDs in Git Changes for Visual
Studio 2022 or Team Explorer for previous versions of Visual Studio:
Use the git-commit
 command and include the work item ID in your
comment. For example, apply this comment #35 Catch null exception  to

As shown in the following image, the Deployment control displays release information
for two release stages. It includes work items linked to a Git commit or pull request for a
release pipeline configured to integrate with Azure Boards.
The Deployment control provides several features to help you manage and track the
release status of work items. The following list outlines these features:
Default appearance: The Deployment control appears on the work item forms for
User Story (Agile), Product Backlog Item (Scrum), Issue (Basic), Requirement
(CMMI), Feature, Epic, Bug, Task, and Test Case work item types by default.
Custom work item types: Custom work item types that use the Inherited process
are automatically enabled.
your commit. When you push the commit, the system creates a Commit link
between the commit and work item #35.
Use the Development control for Git development from the work item. For
more information, see Drive Git development from a work item in Azure
Boards.
Deployment control


# Page 457

Release information: The Deployment control shows the release information for
two stages of the release pipeline integrated with Azure Boards.
Linked work items: This control only shows the work items that are linked to a Git
commit or pull request for this pipeline.
Visual insight: Gain visual insight into the status of a work item as it is deployed to
different release environments and quickly navigate to each release stage and run.
Commit associations: Work items associated with commits in the build show the
status of the release.
Project scope: Only work items within the same project get linked to where the
release pipeline is defined.


# Page 458

Stage visibility: When you open a work item, you can see the stages in real time.


# Page 459

To populate the Deployment control, do the following steps:
1. Define a Classic release pipeline and set up the release stages as described in
Define your multi-stage continuous deployment (CD) pipeline.
2. Configure the pipeline.
７ Note
The Deployment control requires configuration of a Classic release pipeline. It
doesn't support linking to release stages defined for a YAML pipeline.


# Page 460

3. Link work items to a commit or pull request in Azure Repos Git repository. For
more information, see:
Drive Git development from a work item
Link to work items from other objects
4. Run the pipeline.
Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) allows you to link work items to version control
changesets or versioned source code files using the Changeset and Versioned Item link
types. When you check in pending changes or use My Work to check in changes, work
items are automatically linked to your changes. For more information, see Check in your
work.
Test-related link types link test case management work items to one another or to other
work items. From the web portal or Microsoft Test Manager, you can view which test
cases are defined for a test suite and which test suites are defined for a test plan. These
objects aren't linked to each other through link types.
You can link work items to test cases using the Tested/Tested By link types. Use the
same link controls you use to link work items to other work items. See Link work items.
Link work items to TFVC code development
Link work items to tests


# Page 461

The following image shows the full set of link types that you can use with test
management work item types. Most links between test management objects occur by
running a task from the Test pages or Microsoft Test Manager.
For example, when you add Shared Steps to a Test Case, they automatically get linked
using the Test Case/Shared Steps link types. For more information, see Share steps
between test cases.



# Page 462

From the Test section, you can add test plans, test suites, and test cases, which are
automatically linked. You can't add these items through a specific link type. The test
system creates and manages the associations of test results to test cases and test plans.
You can use a hyperlink or storyboard link type to link a work item to a website, network
share, or document on a network share. Both link types are one-way links. To add these
link types, use the same controls described earlier. See Link work items.
When using the storyboard link type, specify a storyboard or document that provides
work item specifications. This link type allows your team to access the shared file and
add their comments.
Link work items to a Web site, network share,
storyboard, or document
View dependencies and track related work


# Page 463

Azure DevOps provides several ways to view dependencies and track related work:
Query Editor: You can use the Query Editor to create custom queries that show all
work items linked to a specific work item.
Backlogs and Boards: The Backlogs and Boards views show parent-child
relationships between work items, allowing you to see dependencies at a glance.
Dependency Tracker: The Dependency Tracker is a Power BI report that provides a
visual representation of dependencies between work items.
To view the list of all objects linked to a work item, do the following steps:
1. Open the work item and select 
 Links. The links tab indicates the count of all
linked objects. Linked objects get grouped under their link type, with a count
within each group.
2. (Optional) Expand or collapse each group, and sort within each group by State,
Latest Update, or Comment by choosing the corresponding column title.
For example, the following Links tab shows a portion of the 64 linked objects for a
work item.
Links prefaced with the 
 exclamation mark indicate that the build, release, or
other object is deleted. Due to retention policies, these objects automatically get
deleted after a certain time period.



# Page 464

To filter items based on hierarchical links, use the Tree of work items query type. To filter
items based on all link types, use Work items and direct links.
To find work items linked to other work items with specific link types, use a query that
shows a primary and a secondary set of work items:

The secondary set is linked to the primary set.
You can’t query for work items in releases, but you can query for work items with
external links. Add more query filters to refine your search.
For more information, see Query work items by link or attachment count.
You can't construct a query that shows a hierarchical view of Test Plans, Test Suites, and
Test Cases. These items aren't linked together using Parent/Child or any other link type.
You can only view the hierarchy through the Test > Test Plans page. For more
information, see Create test plans and test suites.
You can add, remove, and show details of links to a work item with the az boards work-
item relation command. For more information, see Get started with Azure DevOps CLI.

Copy or clone work items and more
Article • 09/09/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
There are two types of copy functions you can use:
Copy or clone a single work item: To duplicate a single work item, use the "Create
copy of a work item" feature. Depending on the options you choose, this process
can be considered either a copy or a clone.
Copy a list of work items: To copy a list of work items, multi-select a list of work
items and use the "Copy as HTML" or "Copy to clipboard" feature.
Project access: Be a project member.
Permissions:
Have View work items in this node and Edit work items in this node
permissions set to Allow. By default, the Contributors group has these
permissions. For more information, see Set work tracking permissions.
To add new tags to work items, have at least Basic access and the project-level
Create new tag definition permission set to Allow. By default, the Contributors
group has this permission.
７ Note
The images in your web portal might differ from those in this article due to updates
made to Azure DevOps Services. However, unless explicitly mentioned, the basic
functionality remains the same.
Prerequisites
７ Note
Stakeholders can't add new tags, even if the permission is explicitly set,
due to their access level. For more information, see Stakeholder access
quick reference.

Email work items: All project members, including those in the Readers group, can
send emails containing work items.
Copy a work item to create a new work item with a new ID and prepopulated fields from
the original. You can modify the fields as needed. A related link to the original work item
and any parent link are copied over, but history and attachments are not.
Clone a work item to create an exact copy of an existing work item, including all fields
and attachments, but with a new ID. Cloning is useful when no field modifications are
needed.
In summary, copy a work item to adjust prepopulated values, and clone a work item to
create an exact duplicate.
1. From the web portal, open the work item you want to copy or clone, open the …
context menu, and choose Create copy of work item.
2. Choose the project and work item type if different from the copied work item.
Optionally change the Title and provide more details.
Copy or clone a work item

Choose options:
Include existing links: To include all Related and external links in the copied
work item. A Related link gets created automatically for the work item
copied, and included in the Discussion section. There's no method for
disabling this feature.
Include existing attachments: To include attachments in the copied work
item
Include child work items: To include existing links to child work items in the
copied work item. This feature isn't recursive. Only those work items directly
linked as children to the work item being copied are included. This option
appears even if there are no child items linked to the work item.
７ Note
When you copy the work item to a different project, Include child work
items is disabled.
When you copy a work item and choose to Include child work items, a
copy gets made of each child work item and linked to the copied work
item through a parent-child link.


# Page 472

3. In the work item form that opens, update other fields as needed. Select OK. All
work items start in the "New" state.
If you have a large number of work items whose type you want to change, use Change
work item type. If the Change work item type option isn't available to you, you can
export a set of work items using Excel or CSV, copy them to a new list, and reimport
them by specifying a different work item type. See Bulk add or modify work items with
Excel or Import or update work items in bulk by using CSV files.
You can copy an HTML formatted table of selected items from either a backlog page or
query results list. Then, you can send an email of this list using your choice of email
client, or paste the list into a Word document, Excel spreadsheet, or other application.
1. From the web portal, open a backlog or query results page, and multi-select the
work items you want to copy to the clipboard.
2. Open the … context menu of one of the selected work items, and then choose
Copy to clipboard or Copy as HTML.
The Include child work items feature requires installation of Azure

Use @mentions in work items and pull
requests
Article • 01/06/2025
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
The @mention control allows you to quickly add a user or group to a work item or pull
request discussion. Using the people picker within the @mention control, you can select
a project member or group from the search list. The mentioned user or group receives
an email notification about your comment.
For organizations that manage their users and groups using Microsoft Entra ID, people
pickers support searching all users and groups within Microsoft Entra ID. You can search
for users and groups beyond those users added to your project. For more information,
see Limit identity search and selection.
Use the @mention control to start or continue a discussion in the following areas:
Work item discussions or any rich-text fields
Pull request discussions
Commit comments
Changeset or shelveset comments
７ Note
You can post an @mention via API. To get the Azure DevOps User ID, see Get the
Azure DevOps User Id.
If your organization is using the existing HTML editor, add the following HTML
code:
If your organization is using the new Markdown editor for comments, use the
following code:
<div><a href="#" data-vss-mention="version:2.0,{user id}">@John 
Doe</a> Testing mentioning</div>
@<UserID>


# Page 482

1. Enter @ in a code comment in a pull request to trigger the @mention people
picker.
2. View the list of users you recently mentioned.
3. Search the directory by selecting a name from the list or entering the name of the
user you're looking for.
To filter the list, enter the user name or alias until you find a match.
Names of mentioned users appear in blue text. Choose the @mention link name to
open the user's contact information, providing more context for why they were added to
the conversation.
You can also use group mentions. Enter the name of a team or a security group, choose
 Search, and then select from the options listed.
Identity search selection
２ Warning
If you have permission to invite users to the organization, regardless of whether the
Restrict invitations policy is disabled, you can @mention a user who isn't part of
your organization. This action invites that user to your organization. For more
information, see Restrict new user invitations from project and team
administrators.


# Page 483

Upon completion of your selection and text entry, your @mention user receives an
email alerting them about the mention.
７ Note
Don't copy and paste @mention users from a previous comment. Although the
formatting may look identical to a properly entered mention, it doesn't register as a
true mention and doesn't send an email notification.


# Page 484

Use the @mention control in pull request discussions, commit comments, changeset
comments, and shelveset comments.
 Tip
Since there's no direct @CreatedBy  macro, you can use the @Me  macro in
combination with the "Created By" field to filter work items created by you. For
example, to tag the creator of items with blank descriptions, you can run a query to
identify such items and then manually tag the creators in the comments section of
each work item, asking them to update the description.
Limited identities in search selection


# Page 485

People pickers generally search and select any user or group added to an organization's
Microsoft Entra ID.
For organizations using Microsoft Entra ID to manage users and groups, people pickers
support searching all users and groups within the directory. To limit the search and
selection to only those users and groups added to a specific project, enable the Limit
user visibility and collaboration to specific projects preview feature for your
organization.
When the Limit user visibility and collaboration to specific projects preview feature is
enabled for an organization, the list of identities you can select from a people picker is
limited in the following ways:
Users added to the Project-Scoped Users group can only select from an identity
list that contains users and groups explicitly added to the project they're
connected to.
If all project members are added to the Project-Scoped Users group, people
pickers are limited to only those users and groups added to the project. All project
members can only select identities that match users and groups explicitly added to
the project they're connected to.
） Important
The limited visibility features described in this section apply only to
interactions through the web portal. With the REST APIs or azure devops  CLI
commands, project members can access the restricted data.
Guest users who are members in the limited group with default access in
Microsoft Entra ID, can't search for users with the people picker. When the
preview feature's turned off for the organization, or when guest users aren't
members of the limited group, guest users can search all Microsoft Entra
users, as expected.
２ Warning
Enabling the Limit user visibility and collaboration to specific projects preview
feature prevents project-scoped users from searching for users added to the
organization through Microsoft Entra group membership, rather than through an
explicit user invitation. This is an unexpected behavior, and a resolution is in

Add work item tags to categorize and
filter lists and boards
Article • 11/27/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Tag work items to quickly filter the product backlog or a work item query by categories
that you define. A tag corresponds to a one or two keyword phrase that you define and
that supports your needs to filter a backlog or query, or define a query.
Tags are a better choice for filtering work items than using text strings as described in
Define a query/Best practices.
You can add and modify tags from the web portal, from Team Explorer plug-in for Visual
Studio. Also, you can open a query in Excel to modify tags in bulk.
Permissions:
To view, follow, and edit work items, have View work items in this node and
Edit work items in this node permissions set to Allow. By default, the
Contributors group has these permissions. For more information, see Set work
tracking permissions.
To add tags to work items, have the project-level Create new tag definition
permission set to Allow. By default, the Contributors group has this permission.
Access levels:
Be a project member.
To add new tags to work items or to view or follow pull requests, have at least
Basic access.
To view or follow work items, have at least Stakeholder access. For more
information, see About access levels.
All project members, including those in the Readers group, can send emails
containing work items.
７ Note
Tags are a shared resource associated with a project and not a team. If your project
contains multiple teams, all teams add to and work from the same set of tags.
Prerequisites


# Page 488

By default, all Contributors and Stakeholders in public projects can add
new and existing tags. In private projects, Stakeholders can only add
existing tags. To control the ability to create new tags, set the Create tag
definition permission at the project level. For more information, see Change
project-level permissions.
Tags should be 400 characters or less and not contain separators such as a ,  (comma),
;  (semicolon), or other formatting character.
Recommendation: Don't use the @  character in a tag. Tags that start with the @
character can't be used in a work item query. The @  character signifies a macro within a
query and therefore the tag isn't recognized as a tag.
From the web portal, open a work item and add a tag. Choose Add tag and type your
keyword. Or, select from the list of previously assigned tags.
To add several tags at one time, type a comma between tags. Tags are case sensitive.
Tags that appear in the tag bar are already assigned to the work item. To unassign a tag,
choose the x on the tag,

７ Note
Provide Stakeholder access to members who want to contribute to the
discussion and review progress. These are typically members who don't
contribute to code, but want to view work items, backlogs, boards, and
dashboards.
Add tags to a work item
Bulk add or remove tags


# Page 489

You can bulk update work items to add or remove tags from the web portal. You bulk
modify tags in the same way as you bulk modify other fields using the web portal. Or,
you can use Excel to bulk add or remove tags.
To query work items based on tags, add a clause for each tag you want to use to
support your query.
You can use the Contains or Does Not Contain operators. Tags that start with the @
character can't be used in a work item query as the query editor interprets the @

Bulk modifying tags from Visual Studio or other supported clients isn't supported.
Query for work items based on tags
 Tip
To understand how AND/OR  clauses are grouped, see Create and save managed
queries, Group clauses. To view the WIQL syntax for a query, install the WIQL
query editor extension
 which allows you to see the WIQL version of any query
editor entry.

Choose Column Options to add the Tags field to the product backlog or a work item
query. If the option doesn't appear, choose More commands 
 to select it from the
menu of options.
７ Note
You can't query for work items that don't have any tags attached to them. If you'd
like to up vote the request to support this feature, you can do so on our Developer
Community page, Be able to search for empty tags
.

From the web portal, you can filter backlogs, boards, and query results using tags.
Begin by choosing Filter 
 .
Check the boxes of those tags that you want to filter on. Keep the OR selection to run a
logical OR for all the tags you selected. Or, choose the AND option to run a logical AND
on all the selected tags.
Filter lists using tags


# Page 493

You can't delete tags using the Azure DevOps Web UI.
If you need to remove a tag, you can create a script or application capable of a delete
using the Azure DevOps REST API or the .NET client libraries. For more examples, see
Azure-DevOps-Admin-CLI
.
Another option is to install the Marketplace Tags Manager
, which adds a Tags page
under Boards or Work to manage tags, including deletes.
Highlight tags on board cards by color-coding them. These colors only appear on the
board that you configure. They don't appear on backlogs or Taskboards. For more
information, see Customize cards, color-code tags.

You can't group a query-based chart by tags, but, you can group a Chart for Work Items
widget by tags that you add to a dashboard. This feature is in public preview. To enable
it, see Manage or enable features and turn on Enable group by tags for work item
chart widget on dashboard.
To group a Chart for Work Items widget by tags, complete the same steps provided in
Track progress with status and trend query-based charts, Add a chart widget to a
dashboard. Make sure that your flat-list query contains Tags in the query clause or as a
column option. Then, choose Tags for the Group by selection. To filter the chart to show
only some tags, choose the Selected tags radio button and then choose the tags you
want the chart to display.

While no hard limit exists, creating more than 100,000 tags for a project collection can
negatively affect performance. Also, the autocomplete dropdown menu for the tag
control displays a maximum of 200 tags. When more than 200 tags are defined, begin
entering to cause the tag control to display relevant tags.
You can't assign more than 100 tags to a work item or you receive the following
message:
Save the work item with the tags (100 or less) that you added, and then you can add
more tags.
Limit queries to fewer than 25 tags. More than that amount and the query likely times
out.

Using work items to track your work provides a host of benefits, including the ability to
easily share information. You can capture most information within the work item
Description or other rich-text formatted field. If you need to maintain the information in
a different format, you can easily link to or attach a file.
Emailing lists of work items is a common way to share work tracking information. The
following table indicates which tasks or features are supported from the web portal and
Visual Studio.
Task/feature

７ Note
The tasks/features listed in the following table aren't available when you're
connected to a GitHub or third-party Git repository. Also, they aren't available from
Visual Studio under the following conditions:
If you're set to use the new Git Tool as described in Git experience in Visual
Studio.

We strongly recommend that everyone use the default view instead of the legacy
view. It is designed for you to quickly access a list of work items based on your
assignment, following, mentioned, or recent updates. The legacy view is no longer
being enhanced and we expect to remove it in a future release of Visual Studio.

Another way to share items is by emailing summary lists, such as a sprint summary plan
or active bugs list. You can share items from a backlog or query results list.
Depending on the option and client you choose, summary lists may or may not include
a hyperlink to the work item ID.
To email items from the web portal: Open a backlog or query and highlight the
items from the list. Open the context menu for one of the selected items and select
to email them.

Move work items from one team to
another team
Article • 01/03/2025
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
When you add a team or reorganize existing teams, you might need to transfer work
items from one team to another by updating their Area Paths. Every work item in Azure
DevOps is assigned to an Area Path, which determines team ownership and influences
how work items are displayed on backlogs and boards.
Work items categorized under the Requirements category appear on a team's backlog
based on their assignment to the team's Area Path. Similarly, assigning other work items
to a team's Area Path supports queries and reporting based on team ownership.
Permissions:
To view, follow, and edit work items, have View work items in this node and
Edit work items in this node permissions set to Allow. By default, the
Contributors group has these permissions. For more information, see Set work
tracking permissions.
To add tags to work items, have the project-level Create new tag definition
permission set to Allow. By default, the Contributors group has this permission.
Access levels:

Area Path permissions: View and Edit work items under the Area Path nodes. For
more information, see Modify work items under an area or iteration path.
Configured area paths: Ensure that the target team has its Area Paths correctly
configured. If not, set up the required Area Paths before transferring work items.
Consistent process model: Teams should be using a compatible process model
(Inherited, Hosted XML, or On-premises XML) to ensure seamless movement of
work items.
Backup work items: We recommend you back up or export work items before
performing bulk moves to prevent data loss if there's an error.
Tools: To use Azure CLI commands, install Azure CLI as described in Get started
with Azure DevOps CLI.
To move work items under a team, do the following steps:
1. Create a query of all work items you want to reassign.
2. Multi-select those items, which belong to each team, and bulk edit the area path.

After you move work items from one team to another team, do the following actions if
you don't see the work items:
Refresh: Refresh the board or select Show more items if newly added work items
don't appear.
Verify team: Check that you selected the right team to ensure the items appear on
the backlog.
Verify Area Path: Verify that the moved work items are assigned to the correct
Area Path that corresponds to the team's backlog. Each team has specific Area
Paths that determine which work items show up on their backlog. This action is
crucial for ensuring visibility in the backlog.
Verify Iteration Path: Check the Iteration Path for the sprint. The sprint backlog
only displays work items assigned to the selected sprint's Iteration Path.
Verify work item types and filters: Review your backlog filters and that work item
types are correctly categorized to ensure all relevant items display.

Modify work items in bulk in Azure
Boards
Article • 11/22/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Use bulk modify when you need to quickly make the same change to many work items.
For example, you might want to change the priority of several bugs or reassign several
tasks to the same team member. Use the web portal to quickly modify one or more
fields for work items that contain the same value.
With bulk modify, you can edit fields and add or remove tags. You can also reassign
work or move work to a specific sprint. You can also use bulk modify to change the work
item type or move work items to other projects. The options available to you depend on
the platform you work from and the permissions assigned to you.
Permissions:
To view, follow, and edit work items, have View work items in this node and
Edit work items in this node permissions set to Allow. By default, the
Contributors group has these permissions. For more information, see Set work
tracking permissions.
To add tags to work items, have the project-level Create new tag definition
permission set to Allow. By default, the Contributors group has this permission.
Access levels:
Be a project member.
To add new tags to work items or to view or follow pull requests, have at least
Basic access.
To view or follow work items, have at least Stakeholder access. For more
information, see About access levels.
 Tip
To add work items in bulk or update multiple fields with different values, use CSV
Import. You can't complete a bulk add of work items through the web portal.
Prerequisites


# Page 514

All project members, including those in the Readers group, can send emails
containing work items.
Team members who belong to the Contributors group can complete the following tasks.
Members provided with Stakeholder access can run multi-select, bulk edit, change type,
email, and copy as HTML/copy to clipboard actions. For more information, see Get
started as a Stakeholder.

７ Note
Provide Stakeholder access to members who want to contribute to the
discussion and review progress. These are typically members who don't
contribute to code, but want to view work items, backlogs, boards, and
dashboards.
By default, all Contributors and Stakeholders in public projects can add
new and existing tags. In private projects, Stakeholders can only add
existing tags. To control the ability to create new tags, set the Create tag
definition permission at the project level. For more information, see
Change project-level permissions.

To start a bulk edit, begin by multi-selecting the work items you want to modify. Select
them from query results or the backlog. You can craft your query using the query editor
or search box. For more information, see Define a work item query.
Multi-select of work items on the backlog and sprint backlogs works in the same way as
multi-select works within query results.

You can't perform certain functions on work items whose work item types
belong to the hidden types category. This category includes all work items
that track tests (such as test cases, shared steps, and shared parameters), code
review requests and responses, and feedback requests and responses.
You can choose to copy or clone a single work item from a query results list or
from the Actions menu of the work item form. You can only perform a clone
or copy action for a single work item. Choose Copy work item when you want
to create a copy of a work item and change its work item type. Choose Clone
when you want to create another instance of the work item without changes
to its work item type.
Be a member of the Project Administrators group or be granted explicit
permissions to Move work items.
Edit multiple work items in bulk


# Page 516

You can use bulk modify by selecting work items from the backlog page or query results
list. From the backlog page context menu, change the backlog priority of several items:
Change position or Move to iteration. Then, assign them to a team member, move
them to a different sprint, or map them to a feature.
The menu options available to you change depending on the platform you work from
and whether you work from a backlog page or query results list.
Backlog menu
Query results multi-select menu


# Page 517

To select several items in a sequence, select the first item of the sequence, hold down
Shift, and select the last item of the sequence. To select several nonsequential items,
hold down Ctrl and select the items to be selected one after the other. You can either
drag the selected items to a new position within the backlog or to a different sprint if
the Planning  side pane is enabled.
To open the context menu, select (
 ) or (  ), and then choose the option from the
menu.
This example uses the context menu to move several nonsequential items to the current
sprint.
Select multiple items and open the context menu


# Page 518

With work items selected, open the context menu for any selected item, and reassign all
of them. You can assign them to a member of your team or to another sprint or iteration
at the same time.
 Tip
Use the backlog Create Query feature to create a query with the backlog items. You
can then open the query within the web portal or Excel to perform additional bulk
updates.
Reassign work items


# Page 519

For more information about the Assign To and Iteration Path fields, see Workflow and
board fields and Query by area or iteration path.
To assign or modify several fields, choose Edit from the context menu of one of the
selected work items. Enter a value for each field that you want to update.
1. For audit purposes, you can add a description for your bulk update task. For more
information about each field, see the Work item field index.
Edit one or more fields


# Page 520

2. From the Query results page, save all work items that you bulk-modified. When
you bulk modify items from the backlog, they're automatically saved. Work items
shown in bold text indicate that local changes aren't saved to the data store. The
Save items button might be in a different place in the UI than shown in the
following picture, depending on the layout of your browser and the specific
version in use.
From any product, sprint, or portfolio backlog, you can drag a multi-selected list of work
items and drop it onto a sprint in the Planning pane to change its iteration path. This
action is not supported for users with Stakeholder access.
Move work items to a sprint


# Page 521

1. To open the Planning pane, choose the 
 view options icon and select Planning.
You can choose to set In Progress items to On or Off.
The set of sprints selected for your team appears. If you don't see any sprints
listed, you can add sprints or select existing sprints for your team's use. To learn
how, see Manage sprint timelines.
2. You can drag items from the Backlog onto a sprint.
This action updates the Iteration Path of the backlog items and any of its child
tasks to the sprint you selected.
Modify rich-text fields in bulk


# Page 522

Rich-text fields support entry of HTML syntax tags to support formatting. Rich-text fields
correspond to the Description, Acceptance Criteria, Repos Steps, and others listed in
Example queries for select fields.
You can bulk update a rich-text field by using the bulk modify tool, selecting the field,
and entering the text with syntax in the Value field. Or, you can create a work item
template with the text you want to use and complete a bulk update by applying the
template to the selected work items. For more information, see Use work item
templates.
For an example using templates showing entry of HTML formatted syntax, see Sample
work item templates, Add guidance in a rich-text field.
From the Edit work items dialog, select Tags (Add) or Tags (Remove).
This example adds the Service tag to the selected work items.

To add fields or customize a work item form, see Customize your work tracking
experience. The method you use depends on the process model that supports your
project.
For large scale, organizational moves, use the REST API calls for Work item batch
operations.
At this time, you can't move work items to a different organization or collection. You can
only migrate work item information by exporting and then importing them using Excel.
If you implemented a custom control that supports multiple values
, you can use Excel
to bulk edit the field. You can't modify it using the web portal. You can only select a
single value for the field.

You can add, modify, publish, and refresh work items using any query type and list type.
Use a flat list to bulk add or modify several types of work items at once, such as
backlog items, tasks, bugs, or issues.
Use a tree list to bulk add or modify work items and their tree-topology links.
Follow these best practices:
Input list, flat list: Import a list of work items or create new work items without
hierarchy.
Input list, tree list: Complete top-down planning and import hierarchically linked
work items.
Query list, tree list: View and modify the hierarchy of link relationships of many
existing work items.
Query list, flat list: Bulk update a list of work items or create new work items
without hierarchy.
Query types:
None: Indicates an input list.
Query title: Indicates the list of work items is tied to the specified query.
Azure Boards supports three query types, indicated by icons next to each query:
Flat list of work items: Imported as a flat list query.
Work items and direct links: Imported as a flat list query.
Use list and query types
Query types


# Page 526

Tree of work items: Imported as a tree list.
Direct links queries are imported as a flat list into Excel, as modifying multiple types of
links isn't supported in Excel.
You can bulk add a nested list of work items, such as a work breakdown structure or
hierarchical user stories. For example, you can add a nested list of tasks, subtasks, and
bugs, or link tasks to product backlog items.
List types:
Flat list: A simple list of work items with a single Title column. No link
management is supported.
Tree list: A hierarchical list of work items that supports creating and updating tree
topology links, such as Parent-Child links, between work items. These lists include
two or more Title columns.
Parent-child links or other tree topology link types support creating a hierarchical
backlog structure. The work item types that participate in the hierarchy differ with
different processes and are shown in the following images.
Tree lists


# Page 527

Hierarchies
The following image shows the hierarchy for the Agile process backlog work item:
User Stories and tasks are used to track work.
Bugs track code defects.
Epics and features are used to group work under larger scenarios.
Each team can configure how they manage Bug work items at the same level as
User Story or Task work items. Use the Working with bugs setting. For more
information about using these work item types, see Agile process.
To import a hierarchical list, see Add or import a hierarchical list of work items later in
this article.
You can open any query you defined in Azure Boards in Excel, including queries under
My Queries and Shared Queries. However, if you plan to share the workbook with other
team members, use a Shared Query. Other team members can't access workbooks or
worksheets based on personal queries stored under your My Queries folder.
You can use most Excel features when you work with a list of work items.
Features:
Format a cell or apply conditional formatting to a cell or column
Agile process
My queries versus shared queries
Use Excel features


# Page 528

Cut and paste from one cell to other cells
Cut and paste a single row
Sum a column or add other formulas
Fill down cells
Filter
Add multiple worksheets to your workbook
Each worksheet in Excel can contain a different input list or query. However, all
worksheets within the workbook must connect to the same project within an
organization or project collection.
The following features behave differently when working with a worksheet connected to
Azure Boards.
Each cell or column of cells corresponds to a work item field. Each field is
associated with a data type. You can't enter data into an Excel cell that doesn't
meet the data type and requirements for that field.
You can only insert a single row at a time within the worksheet.
You can copy and paste multiple rows within the worksheet.
To move a work item within a hierarchy, cut the entire row and paste it under the
work item you want as its parent.
Use Outdent and Indent to change the location of a work item within the tree.
Undo (Ctrl Z) might not work. If you do something that you want to revert, you can
refresh the worksheet.
We recommend you publish and refresh your worksheet often to make sure your local
work remains in sync with Azure Boards data store. For more information about Excel,
see Basic Excel tasks
 .
You can sort work item flat lists using the Excel sort feature
. But, if you're working
from a tree list, you don't want to do any type of sort. Doing so changes the tree
structure and as such, the links between work items.
If you want to use Excel to manage the order of your work items as they appear in a
team backlog, you can do that by using the Stack Rank or Backlog Priority field (Agile or
Scrum process). You can set values in these fields, publish your worksheet, and refresh
your backlog. Your backlog items should appear reordered based on lowest to highest
number. However, the next time the backlog is reordered from the backlog, the values
you entered are subject to change.
Sort work items


# Page 529

To maintain a specific order of work items, consider adding a custom field to manage
the sort order. You can then use this field within Excel to sort your flat list of work items.
This option doesn't change the order in which work items appear in your backlog.
You can and can't do the following tasks from an Excel worksheet:
Can do:
Add tags and bulk update work items with tags as described in Add work item tags
to categorize and filter lists and boards. Add the Tags field to your worksheet. Add
multiple tags separated by a semicolon (;).
Add simple text to a rich-text field, but if you're updating several work items in
bulk, you might lose formatting in existing work items.
Work offline and then reconnect and publish your changes. For more information,
see Connect Azure Boards to an Office client, Work offline, and reconnect.
Can't do:
Delete work items
Change the work item type of an existing work item
Move work items to another project
Import or update test case steps or other test artifacts
Add work items in any other State than the new State
Add to a work item discussion thread
Link to a remote work item.
1. Open Excel and connect to your Azure Boards project. Use one of the four
methods provided in Connect Azure DevOps project to Excel.
Tasks you can and can't do with Excel
Import work items as a flat list
７ Note
When you connect to Azure Boards in the cloud, the Team Project Collection
is automatically selected as there is only one collection associated with your
Azure DevOps Services organization. When you connect to Azure Boards in an
on-premises server, you choose the Team Project Collection prior to choosing
the project.


# Page 530

2. In Excel, start with a blank worksheet. If you don't see the Team ribbon (or the
Team menu if you use Excel 2007), ensure that you installed the Azure DevOps
Office Integration 2019 tool
. For more information, see Azure DevOps Office
integration issues.
3. Choose New List from the Team ribbon.
4. From the New List dialog, choose Input list.
5. Your worksheet is now bound to your project as an input list (Query[None]), flat
list.
6. Specify the titles of the work items you want to add and their work item type.


# Page 531

The State and Reason fields automatically populate with default values once your
select the work item type.
7. Publish your worksheet.
Make sure your cursor is in a cell that contains data. Otherwise, the Publish button
might appear disabled.
You work items now have ID numbers.
8. To assign values to other fields, open Choose Columns, add the fields, make the
assignments, and publish your changes.
 Tip
When you add work items to a team backlog, ensure you specify the team's
Area Path and Iteration Path. If you need to add Area Paths or Iteration Paths,


# Page 532

9. To open a work item to add more information, Choose the work item you want to
open and then choose Open in Web Access. Before you do, make sure you publish
any changes you made.
A web browser opens and displays the work item. If you make changes to the work
item, immediately refresh your worksheet to capture the changes.
You can add a hierarchy of work items linked using parent-child links or other tree
topology link type.
1. Starting from Step 5 from the previous procedure, convert your flat list, input list
into a tree list. Choose a cell within the flat list and then select Add Tree Level.
select Edit Areas and Iterations. This link opens the Project settings page in a
web browser. For more information, see Define area paths and assign to a
team and Define Iteration Paths and configure team iterations.
Import work items as a tree list
） Important
Avoid sorting a tree list, as it can alter the hierarchical link relationships.


# Page 533

If the Add Tree Level is disabled, you're working from a query list. To convert your
list to a tree list, you must first reconfigure your list to an input list.
2. Choose the link type to use when you're adding work items to a hierarchy, and
then select Convert. The most usual choice is Parent-Child. You can only select
from tree topology link types. For more information, see Link type topologies and
restrictions.
The List type changes to Tree and a second Title column appears.
3. To add more levels to the hierarchy, select Add Tree Level again. For example, if
you want to add a hierarchy of Epics, Features, and User Stories, you want to have
Title 1, Title 2, and Title 3 columns.
If you want to add tasks, add another tree level to have four title columns. To
remove a column, see Remove a tree level.
4. Save your Excel file.
5. Enter the Work Item Type and Titles for the hierarchy you want to import. The
State fields automatically fill in with default values once you select the work item
type.


# Page 534

6. Publish your worksheet.
Make sure your cursor is in a cell that contains data. Otherwise, the Publish button
might appear disabled.
IDs are now assigned to your work items. In the background, the link type you
selected is used to link each work item in the hierarchy. Epics are linked to
Features. Features are linked to User Stories.
7. To check the links made, choose a work item and choose Links and Attachments.
For example, here we show the Child and Parent links created for a Feature that
was imported.


# Page 535

8. To enter a row under a work item where you want to add a child, choose the row
and then choose Add Child.
9. To assign values to other fields, open Choose Columns, add the fields, make the
assignments, and publish your changes.
10. To change the hierarchy, cut and paste the entire row of a work item to place it
under the new parent. When you publish the change, the old hierarchical links are
deleted, and the new hierarchical links are created.
You can use the 
 or 
 indent/outdent icons to demote or promote a
work item within the tree hierarchy. Ensure the header at the top of the column reads
Title n; if it doesn't, add a tree level.
1. First, publish changes that you made to work items before you remove a tree level.
Removing a tree level requires a refresh, which overwrites data in the work item
list. You lose any data you didn't publish.
Remove a tree level


# Page 536

2. Next, delete any content under the tree-level Title number column you want to
remove—the highest numbered column—. This column should be the highest
numbered column in the tree.
3. Refresh your worksheet. The column containing empty values for the Title is
removed.
You get an error message if you attempt to delete the column.
Excel uses the data in the Title columns to determine the pattern of links between work
items. When you publish changes, any of the following conditions can result in an error,
an invalid link, or a tree link being created between incorrect work items:
A row between the work items is blank within the hierarchy.
The title of a work item is in the wrong column. Ensure you enter a title for each
child work item.
Multiple Title columns contain data within a row. Enter text in only one of the title
columns per row.
The list was sorted. Avoid sorting a tree list, as it can change the hierarchical link
relationships. If you do sort a tree list, recover by immediately refreshing.
To resolve an error, see Resolve invalid links.
Additionally, a parent-child linked work item can only have one parent. You can't add
the same work item task to two backlog items. Instead, define distinct work item tasks.
The easiest way to bulk update multiple work items is to create a query for the work
items you want to update, and then open that query in Excel.
Tips for working with a tree list
Update work items in bulk with a query list
 Tip
Keep your work in sync with these tips:
Use 
 (Refresh) when you first open a saved worksheet to download the
latest data from the data store.
Add columns to the worksheet using 
 (Choose Columns) to enter data for
additional fields.


# Page 537

1. From the web portal or Visual Studio, create the work item query that contains the
work items you want to update. For more information, see Create and save
managed queries with the query editor.
2. Open Excel and connect to your Azure Boards project. Use one of the four
methods provided in Connect Azure DevOps project to Excel.
3. If you opened your query from the web portal or Visual Studio, you're done. Make
any changes you want. Open Choose Columns, add fields, make assignments, and
publish your changes.
4. If you start from Excel, open a blank worksheet. You can add a worksheet to an
existing workbook, as long as you're choosing a query from the same project the
workbook is bound to.
5. Choose New List from the Team ribbon.
6. From the New List dialog, choose Query list, and select the query you want from
the drop-down menu.
Publish your additions and modifications often to avoid data conflicts.
Save your workbook periodically to prevent data loss before you publish or
refresh.


# Page 538

The icon next to each query indicates the query type. The first two query types, Flat
list of work items and Work items and direct links are imported as flat list queries.
Only the Tree of work items queries import as a tree list.
7. With the work items imported to Excel, make the modifications you want and
publish your changes.
If you're working with a tree list, see also the information provided in Import a
hierarchical list of work items.
If the Tree group commands aren't available, your worksheet is configured as a flat or
query list. To enable the Tree group commands, convert the list to either an input list or
a list based on a tree query. For more information, see the next section on Change your
list type or query.
You can change the work items listed in your worksheet. Specifically, you can:
Change your flat list to a tree list
Change from a query list to an input list
Change from an input list to a query list
Enable Tree commands
Change your list type or query


# Page 539

Change the query your worksheet references
You can change your flat list to a tree list. However, if your list is a query list, you need to
reconfigure it first. If the Tree group commands are disabled, it indicates a flat or query
list.
To convert your query list to an input list, follow these steps.
1. Publish your changes.
2. On the Team ribbon, choose Configure, List.
3. Choose Refresh work items only and then Apply.
This choice changes the query list to an input list.
4. To convert from an input list to a query list, choose Refresh from query, select the
query, and then Apply.


# Page 540

If you're working from a query, modify your query to contain the work items you want.
Then refresh your list. The other work items appear in your list.
If you're working with an input list, complete these steps.
1. From the Team ribbon, choose Get Work Items.
2. Choose the method you want from the three options available.
Add existing work items to your worksheet


# Page 541

If the work items are defined in another project, then first select the Project. Then,
make your selections:
Query. Use this method when you defined a query that contains the set or
superset of work items you want.
IDs. Use this method when you know the IDs of the work items that you want
to link to. In the IDs box, type the IDs of the work items that you want to find,
separated by commas or spaces.
Title contains. Use this method to find work items that have a common word
or phrase in the title field. In the and type list, select the type of work item
that you want to retrieve.
3. Choose Find.
Only those work items defined for the selected project and specified work item
type are listed. To sort on a column field, choose the column Title.
７ Note
To minimize the time required to run the query, narrow the filter criteria of the
search.


# Page 542

4. In the list of returned work items, select the check-box of one or more work items.
Select each work item that should link to the current work item. You can also
press the SHIFT key while selecting to choose a range of work items, or press
the CTRL key while selecting to choose multiple work items.
Choose Select All to select all work items in the list.
If you start your worksheet with a New List, you see only a set of default field columns.
You can add columns using the Choose Columns on the Team ribbon.
If you start your worksheet from an existing query, you see all the column fields defined
for the query. From there, you can add columns using the Choose Columns. However,
your additions don't modify the underlying query.
1. To assign values to other fields, choose Column Options to add the fields of
interest.
To filter the fields based on work item type, select the Work item type.
To move or remove a field, choose the field and then select the > or < icons.
Add or remove column fields


# Page 543

To change the field sequence, move the field up or down in the list using the
up and down arrows.
You can add a rich-text field, such as the Description field, however you
might lose some of the formatting upon publish.
2. Once the fields appear in the worksheet, assign values and publish your updates.
When working with identity fields, ones that accept user accounts, see the next
section, Select user accounts.
3. Save your worksheet.
Use the Select User feature to find user accounts and assign values to person-named
fields. This feature also provides access to the most recently used (MRU) values. If your
team has hundreds or thousands of user accounts, this feature is especially useful.
1. If you don't have the latest version of Visual Studio (2015.1 or later version
, get it
now. You need the latest update to access the Select User feature.
2. Choose an identity or person-named field to activate the Select User feature in the
Team ribbon.
An identity or person-named field contains a user identity. These fields are typically
synchronized with a user account database, such as Microsoft Entra ID, Active
Directory, or a Workgroup.
3. Begin entering the name of the user account and the Assign User dialog
automatically filters the results until you can select the account of interest.
Select user accounts
 Tip
Without the Select User feature, you must enter user names exactly as they are in
the database, or you'll receive data validation errors when you try to publish.


# Page 544

Enter a letter to jump to names starting with that letter. Only user names are
recognized; account aliases aren't. As you select user names, Excel remembers your
recent selections, allowing you to choose user accounts directly from the field.
You can complete many actions from the Links tab of the Links and Attachments dialog.
Specifically, you can:
Review the existing links defined for the selected work item
Add links to selected work items to one or more work items or select objects
Delete links
Open a linked work item (opens in the web portal)
Edit the link type of an existing link
Add columns to the Link list and sort on that list
For more information on linking work items, see Link user stories, issues, bugs, and
other work items.
You can't use the Links and Attachments dialog to bulk update work item links. To bulk
update tree-topology link types, use a tree list instead.

Select New Report.
For more information, see Create Excel reports from a work item query.
To resolve publishing errors that might arise when you're working in Excel, see one of
the following articles:
Resolve data conflicts: A data conflict occurs when a field value is changed in Azure
Boards since the last time you published from Excel.
Resolve data validation errors: A data validation error occurs if a field value violates
the rules for that field and work item type.
Resolve invalid links in a tree hierarchy: An invalid link happens when a work item
in a hierarchy or tree list and is moved or sorted, breaking the dependencies
between work items. To resolve this error, review the error message and reposition
the work items to restore the correct structure.
Address Error TF208104: Hierarchical Link Relationship Is Locked:
If you receive error TF208104, your changes to the fields are published, but
changes to the link hierarchy aren't. This error occurs because another process
locks at least one of the link relationships for the work item, such as Project Server
integration.
） Important
You can create an Excel report using New Report only from an on-premises Azure
DevOps Server. These reports require your project's collection to be configured to
support SQL Server Analytics Server.

Import, update, and export bulk work
items with CSV files in Azure Boards
Article • 11/27/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Import and export work items in bulk using CSV-formatted files in Azure Boards. While
you can continue to use Excel for bulk imports and updates, the native import/export
feature allows you to manage work items without requiring Excel. For more information,
see Bulk add or modify work items with Excel.
Permissions:
Export work items: Be a member of the Project Administrators security group or
have View project-level information set to Allow.
Import work items: Be a member of the Project Administrators security group or
the Team Foundation Administrators security group.
To import work items in bulk, your CSV file must include the Work Item Type and Title
fields. You can include more fields as needed. Follow these guidelines to import a CSV
file:
Exclude the ID field: Don't include the ID field in your CSV file.
Remove project-specific fields: If the CSV file was exported from a different
project, remove fields specific to the source project, such as Area Path and Tags.
For a list of default fields, see Work Item Field Index.
Include the Test Steps field: When importing test cases, include the Test Steps
field. For more information, see Bulk Import or Export Test Cases.
Don't include Assigned To, Changed Date, Created By, or State fields.
Validate required fields:
Ensure the Work Item Type and Title fields are present in the CSV file.
Confirm that the Work Item Type corresponds to a valid type in the target
project.
Verify that all fields in the CSV file match the fields for the work item types in
the target project.
Prerequisites
Import new work items


# Page 553

Handle invalid values: If the imported CSV file contains work items with invalid
values, you must edit and correct these work items after import before they can be
saved.
Do the following steps to import new work items.
1. Create a local import.csv file and open it in Visual Studio Code or Excel.
2. The file must contain the Work Item Type and the Title fields. You can include
other fields as needed. For a list of default fields, see Work item field index.
The following example includes the Priority field.
csv
3. From the web portal for your project, select Boards > Queries > Import work
items.
７ Note
You can import up to 1,000 work items at a time. If you have more than 1,000 work
items to import, break them into multiple files and import them separately.
Work Item Type,Title,Priority
Issue,Fix issues with code,1
Issue,Merge testing modules,3
Issue,Open private preview for select customers,2
Issue,Enable feature for customer champs,2
Issue,Remove old test code,2

4. Select Choose file, choose your file, and then select Import.
The import process loads the imported work items into the queries view in an
unsaved state. No IDs get assigned.
5. Verify the results and then select Save items to save the work items.


# Page 555

6. The system highlights those work items with data issues. Resolve the data issues
before you save the work items. In this example, an invalid value is in the Priority
field. Fix the data by opening the work item directly. Instead, use bulk edit to fix
several work items with the same issue.
Parent-child links: You can add parent-child links between work items you import
by indenting the title columns, as shown in Can I import a CSV file that have
parent-child links?. However, you can't specify any other link types when you
import or update work items.
Default State field: When you import new work items, the State field is set to New
by default. You can't specify a different state during the import process. If you
need to change the state of imported work items, use the following workaround:
1. Import the work items with the default New state.
2. Export the imported work items to a CSV file.
3. Update the State field values in the exported CSV file.
4. Reimport the updated CSV file to set the desired states.
Default Area and Iteration fields: The Area and Iteration fields default to the top-
level node. This behavior occurs because the import process doesn't have the
context for these fields unless explicitly specified in the CSV file. To set specific
Area and Iteration paths during import, ensure these fields are included in your
CSV file with the correct values. For example:
 Tip
Don't assign IDs to new work items that you add. Assigning IDs results in an
error message.

csv
1. To update work items, create a query that contains all the columns you want to
export and possibly edit. Save your query and select Export to CSV to save the
data.csv file to your local machine.
The exported file should look similar to the following example:
csv
2. Make the edits to your work items. Your CSV file must contain the ID, Work Item
Type, and Title fields. Any other fields you want to include are optional.
Title,Description,Area Path,Iteration Path
"Sample Work Item","This is a sample 
description.","Project\Team","Project\Sprint 1"

７ Note
When you import identity fields, enter the name and email in the following
format "Display Name <email>" . For example, to assign work to Jamal

3. Save the file and import, as described in the previous section.
4. The results list with work items that contain value changes appear highlighted in
bold. Select Save Items to apply the changes.
5. Work items with data issues get highlighted in red and must be resolved before
you can save them. In this example, an invalid value appears in the Assigned To
field. Fix the data by opening the work item directly. You can use bulk edit if you
have many work items with the same issue.
Hartnett, specify "Jamal Hartnett <fabrikamfiber4@hotmail.com>" . If you
specify a value that isn't recognized as a valid user to the system, you may
encounter problems with the import.

From any query, you can export a list of work items as a comma-delimited list. Open the
query, select the 
 actions icon, and then select Export to CSV.
You can use this feature to export work items from one project and import them to
another project. But, before you import them to another project, you must remove the
work item ID. You get an error if you attempt to import new work items to a project with
an ID specified.
HTML fields, such as descriptions and acceptance criteria, include rich text formatting. To
ensure this formatting is preserved, do the following tasks:
Export list as a CSV file
Export and import work items to a different
project
Import HTML fields


# Page 559

1. Ensure your CSV file includes HTML tags within the relevant fields.
2. Import the CSV file into Excel.
Excel might handle multi-line text fields differently, so it's important to check the
formatting after import. Replace lines ending in CRLF  by surrounding sentences with
<p>... </p> .
For example, you can import the following work item, which includes three lines of text
in the Description field.
csv
To disable HTML in multi-line fields to ensure that they're plaintext, use the witadmin
changefield  command. For more information, see Manage Work Item Fields.
Example command:
Windows Command Prompt
When you work with HTML fields across different Microsoft products, you might
encounter formatting inconsistencies. Here are some tips to handle these issues:
Review the formatting after importing to ensure it meets your requirements.
Use appropriate HTML tags and structures to minimize discrepancies. You can add
multiple tags separated by a semicolon. For more information, see Tasks you can
and can't do with Excel.
For more information on managing HTML content and ensuring compatibility, see
Provide help text, hyperlinks, or web content on a work item form.

A: When you use the Web UI, the identity picker goes through extra steps to validate the
user. First it checks to see if the person is a valid user in the org. If not, it searches on the
identity in Microsoft Entra ID. If the user's in Microsoft Entra ID but not in the org, that
user gets added to the valid identities.
When you import from CSV, for performance reasons, the identity picker doesn't go
through these extra steps. It only checks to see if there's a matching User Principal
Name (UPN) already in the org. If it doesn't find a matching UPN, it reports that the
identity is unknown.

Bulk move work items and change the
work item type in Azure Boards
Article • 11/22/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Sometimes, work items get created with the wrong type or assigned to an incorrect
project. You can correct these issues by updating individual work items or bulk
modifying multiple items. You can also remove irrelevant work items from your backlog
or Taskboard.
To change the type of multiple work items, export them using Excel and reimport them
with the correct type.
In the web portal, multi-select work items from a backlog or query results page to
perform bulk updates. To change, move, delete, or restore multiple work items
simultaneously, see Bulk modify work items.Often you find that someone created a work
item of the wrong work item type (WIT) or within an incorrect project. You can correct
these issues for individual work items or bulk modify several work items. You can also
remove work items added to your backlog or Taskboard that aren't relevant anymore.
For instructions on removing, deleting, or restoring work items, see Remove, delete, or
restore work items.
Permissions:
Be a member of the Contributors or Project Administrators group. To get
added, Add users to a project or team.
To modify work items, have your View work items in this node and Edit work
items in this node permissions set to Allow. By default, the Contributors group
has this permission set. For more information, see Set permissions and access
for work tracking.
To move work items to another project, be a member of the Project
Administrators group or have the Move work items out of this project
permission set to Allow. By default, the Contributors group doesn't have this
permission set. Users with Stakeholder access don't have access to this feature.
Access levels: To change the work item type, have at least Stakeholder access.
Prerequisites
７ Note


# Page 564

For more information, see Change project-level permissions.
Changing the work item type refreshes the work item form with the fields defined for
the type selected. For example, you can change a bug to a task and the form refreshes
with the fields defined for a task.
You can change a single work item or several multi-selected work items to a new type.
1. Open a work item, choose the 
 actions icon, and select the 
 Change type...
option.
Users with Stakeholder access for a public project have full access to all work
tracking features just like users with Basic access. For more information, see
Stakeholder access quick reference.
） Important
You can't change type or move work items whose work item types support test
management or that belong to the Hidden Types Category. This includes all work
items that track tests—such as test cases, shared steps, and shared parameters—
code review requests and responses, and feedback requests and responses.
Change the work item type


# Page 565

Or, from the backlog or query results page, multi-select several work items whose
type you want to change. You can select several work items of the same type or
different type so long as you want to change them all to the same work item type.
Choose the 
 actions icon, and select the 
 Change type... option.

Comments are automatically added to the Discussion and an entry gets made to
the History. Also, the system automatically resets the State and Reason fields to
the default initial values for the work item type that you move.
3. Save the work items.
From the Query Results page, save all work items that you bulk-modified. When
you bulk modify items from the backlog, they're automatically saved. Work items
shown in bold text indicate that local changes aren't saved to the data store. The
system automatically saves each work item. To reflect your changes, refresh.
When you realize that a work item is assigned to the wrong project within your
organization or collection, you can move it to the appropriate project. You can relocate
either a single work item or multiple selected work items.
７ Note
The system automatically resets the State and Reason fields to the default
initial values of the specified type. However, in some cases you may need to
open the work item to change the State or Reason field to a value supported
by the changed-to work item type.
Move a work item to another project

# Page 568

1. Open the work item and choose the 
 Move... option from the work item form's
 Actions menu.
If you don't see the option, then you don't have permissions to move work items
out of the project.
Or, from the backlog or query results page, multi-select several work items that
you want to move to another project. You can select several work items so long as
you want to move them all to the same project.
Choose the 
 actions icon to open the context menu of one of the selected work
items, and choose the 
 Move… option.
2. Select the destination project and choose the other options available, including
changing the work item type. Optionally enter a comment.
Permanent and irreversible deletion: Azure DevOps only supports the permanent
deletion of test artifacts, including test plans, test suites, test cases, shared steps,
and shared parameters. Deleted artifacts cannot be restored, and all associated
child items, such as test results, are also removed. Additionally, bulk deletion of test
artifacts is not supported; attempting to bulk delete will result in the deletion of all
other selected work items except the test artifacts.
Ensure you back up any necessary information before deleting test artifacts, as
this action can't be undone.

You can act on individual work items or bulk modify several work items.
From the web portal, you can multi-select several work items from a backlog or query
results page. You can also do a bulk update using the associated feature. To delete or
restore several work items at the same time, see Modify work items in bulk.
You can also delete or destroy work items in batch with a REST API. For more
information, see Work Items - Delete.
By changing the State of a work item to Removed, you effectively remove it from a
backlog or board view: product, portfolio, and sprint backlogs, boards, and Taskboards.
The Removed state corresponds to the Removed workflow category state. If you define
custom workflow states, any state you map to the Removed workflow category state act
in a similar way. For more information, see Customize the workflow.
To cause removed items to not show up in queries, you must add a clause that filters on
the State field.

Delete test artifacts in Azure Boards
Article • 11/22/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Test artifacts such as test plans, test suites, and test cases are all considered work items
in Azure DevOps. However, the method for deleting test artifacts differs from the
method for deleting nontest work items.
When you delete test artifacts, the following actions occur:
1. Remove from TCM data store:
The deleted test artifact is removed from the Test Case Management (TCM)
data store.
The underlying work item associated with the test artifact is deleted.
2. Delete child items:
A background job initiates the deletion of all child items from both the TCM
data store and the underlying work items.
This process might take a few minutes, depending on the number of artifacts
being deleted.
3. Permanent deletion:
All information in both the work item tracking data store and the TCM data
store is permanently deleted.
Deleted data can't be reactivated or restored under any circumstances.
） Important
Permanent and Irreversible Deletion: Azure DevOps only supports the permanent
deletion of test artifacts, including test plans, test suites, test cases, shared steps,
and shared parameters. Deleted artifacts cannot be restored, and all associated
child items, such as test results, are also removed. Additionally, bulk deletion of test
artifacts is not supported; attempting to bulk delete results in the deletion of all
other selected work items except the test artifacts.
Ensure you back up any necessary information before deleting test artifacts, as
this action cannot be undone.


# Page 582

Permissions:
To delete test runs, be a member of the Project Administrators group or have
the project-level Delete test runs permission set to Allow.
To delete test plans and test suites, be a member of the Project Administrators
group or have the Area Path node-level Manage test plans or Manage test
suites permission set to Allow. If the user isn't part of the project administrator
group, then the user must have project-level Delete test runs permission set to
Allow along with Area Path node level permissions.
Access levels: To manage or delete test artifacts, have at least Basic + Test Plans
access or Visual Studio Enterprise. This level provides access to the full Test Plans
feature set. Users with Basic access and with permissions to permanently delete
work items and manage test artifacts can only delete orphaned test cases, which
means they can delete test cases created from Work that aren't linked to any test
plans or test suites.
::: moniker-end
The following image illustrates the set of work item types that support the test
experience and work with Microsoft Test Manager. These work item types are linked
together using the link types shown.
From the web portal or Microsoft Test Manager, you can view which test cases are
defined for a test suite, and which test suites are defined for a test plan. However, these
objects aren't connected to each other through link types. For definitions of each field
used in these work item types, see Query based on build and test integration fields.

Use work item templates
Article • 04/29/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Visual Studio 2022 | Visual Studio 2019 | Visual Studio 2017 | Visual Studio 2015
With work item templates, you can quickly create work items with prepopulated values
for your team's commonly used fields. You can use work item templates to create work
items or make bulk updates to several work items. You can add and manage work item
templates from the web portal or from Visual Studio 2015 or earlier versions. For
examples showing usage of work item templates, see Sample work item templates.
Work item templates are distinct from process templates. For more information, see
About processes and process templates or these specific articles for default process
templates: Basic, Agile, Scrum, or CMMI.
The availability of template task options depends on your client and platform version.
You can add and manage work item templates from the web portal or from Visual
Studio 2015 or earlier versions. For more information, see the prerequisites in this article.
As shown in the following table, a ✔️ indicates the task is available from the web portal

To manage work item templates in the web portal, be a member of the team
that owns them. You can then add, edit, or delete templates as needed.
To use work item templates in the web portal, be a Contributor to the project.
You can then apply templates to existing work items.
Tools: To add, capture, or edit work item templates through Visual Studio Team
Explorer, install the Microsoft Visual Studio Team Foundation Server 2015 Power
Tools
. These templates only appear in your view of Team Explorer.
Depending on the platform, version, and client you use, you might need to follow
different steps to capture a work item.
Templates captured through the web portal get assigned a GUID.
1. From the web portal, open a work item to use as the basis for a template.
2. Select the 
 actions icon, and then choose Templates > Capture.
 Tip
The templates you define through the web portal are distinct from those you define
through Visual Studio. Web portal templates can only be managed and applied to
work items through the web portal. Similarly, Visual Studio templates can only be
managed, viewed, and applied to work items in Visual Studio. But, you can use the
URLs of both template types to add work items through the web portal.
Prerequisites
Capture a work item as a template
Web portal


# Page 589

Name the template, select the team for which you want to save it under, and
optionally define or clear fields. Save the template when finished.
3. Save the template, and then select Copy link to capture the URL for the
template.


# Page 590

4. You can paste the URL link into a browser to create a work item, or provide it
to others for their use to add work items. For example, you can add it as a
hyperlink to a project wiki, a dashboard via a Markdown widget, or other
shared network resource.
Use the URL whenever you want to add a work item of the same type with
predefined values.
For each work item type, you can see and manage the templates that your team
defined. You can perform various actions on the templates, such as adding, editing,
copying, deleting, renaming, and getting the link.
1. From the web portal, open Project settings.

file, add it to a web page as a hyperlink, copy the link to a shared network, or
send to your team via email. Also, consider adding a link to the team
dashboard.
Create copy: Select Create copy. Name the template, optionally add and
remove fields, and then Save it when you're done.
The main method used to add a work item using a template is to open the template link
within a browser window. To get the template link, see the Edit, delete, copy link, create
copy section.
You can apply a template to a single work item or do a bulk update of several work
items.

Apply a template to several work items


# Page 595

2. Choose the template to apply.
3. Field changes are automatically applied and work items saved. For more
information about bulk updates, see Bulk modify work items.
You can add tags to a template and they're applied to the work item when you use the
template. To add two or more tags, delimit them with a comma (,).
Add or remove tags from templates


# Page 596

If you don't specify tags to remove, then all tags present in a work item remain defined.
They remain defined even when you apply a work item template to an existing work
item.
You can specify a work item template that specifies several field values using the
following syntax. Use the URL whenever you want to add a work item of the same type
with predefined values.
URL
Define an unplanned work item template using
a hyperlink
https://dev.azure.com/{OrganizationName}/{ProjectName}/_workItems/create/{Wo
rkItemType}?


# Page 597

For example, the following syntax specifies a work item task with title TaskTitle. It
specifies values for the Assigned To, Description, Tags, Activity, and Iteration Path fields.
URL
You can save the URL as a text file or add the URL to a dashboard or web page as a
hyperlink.
You can add links to a Markdown widget that appear on your team dashboard in the
web portal. These links open a work item with the template defined fields predefined.
For example, the following widget contains links to three templates.
[FieldReferenceName 1]={FieldValue 1}&
[FieldReferenceName 2]={FieldValue 2}&
[FieldReferenceName 3]={FieldValue 3}&

Article • 07/24/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Work item templates can help save time and provide guidance to your team when
defining user stories, features, bugs, or tasks. Teams use templates to support the
following goals:
Create bugs for specific product areas
Provide guidance to complete the work item
Create work items with specific tags
Define a bug template for use with another application or extension, such as Bug
Bash Pro
.
Review this article for examples of defining specific values of work item templates. For
guidance on adding, managing, and applying work item templates, see Use templates to
add and update work items.
As an organization grows, the number of product or feature areas and number of teams
can grow in number. To support work items to appear on a team's backlog or board,
templates should specify the Area Path that the team owns.
In this example, the Voice team sets the Area Path= Fabrikam Fiber/Voice .
７ Note
Work item templates are distinct from process templates. For more information, see
About processes and process templates or these specific articles for the process
templates: Basic, Agile, Scrum, or CMMI.
Specify the Area Path


# Page 600

For more information about area paths, see About area and iteration (sprint) paths.
To provide guidance, enter HTML syntax into a rich-text field's value.
For example, here we add the following syntax into the Repos Steps field
The work item form renders this example as shown.
Add guidance in a rich-text field
<p><b>Steps to reproduce:</b><br>1.&nbsp; <br><br><b>Expected Behavior:</b>
<br>1. <br><br><b>Affected Branch:</b> <br> <b>Affected Build:</b><br></p>


# Page 601

Work item tags are useful to quickly filter backlogs, boards, or queries. You can add tags
to track anything of interest, for example: Customer issue, Release, Milestone.
To add two or more tags, add them all within a single Tags (Add) field, entering a
comma between tags.
For example, here we add Web and Sept Release.
For more information about tags, see Add work item tags to categorize and filter lists
and boards.
You can also use the Tags (Remove) template field to remove tags from work items. For
example, if many work items were tagged with Milestone 1, and that no longer applies,
you could query for all those work items and remove the tag by doing a bulk apply of a
template that removed the Milestone 1 tag.
You can pre-populate a custom field that has been added to the work item type. Before
adding it to a template, you must first add it to the work item type. For inherited process
models, see Add and manage fields for an inherited process. For On-premises XML
process models, see Add or modify a field to track work.
For example, the Triage custom field can be set to False , indicating the bug needs to be
triaged.

An often requested feature is to allow the creation of a work item that automatically
links to one or more work items. For example, a user story that links to five tasks. Work
item templates don't support this capability. However, you may find a Marketplace
extension supports this feature. For example, see the following extensions:
Work item form one click actions
1-Click Tasks
1-Click Child-Links
You can programmatically interact with work item templates to create, get, list, and

Use backlogs to manage projects
Article • 10/16/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
With backlogs, you can plan your project by adding user stories or requirements to your
product backlog. With your plan in place, you can start driving code development
efforts.
If you're a project administrator, see Configure and customize Azure Boards, which
shows you how to define area and iteration paths and customize your work item types.
When you create a project or add a team, Azure Boards automatically creates a backlog.
Each team has access to their own product, portfolio, and sprint backlogs. For more
information, see About teams and Agile tools.
An Azure Boards backlog is a prioritized list of work items that guides your
developments team's effort. A backlog helps manage project scope and facilitates
effective communication and collaboration through the software development lifecycle.
Use backlogs to do the following tasks:
Define user stories, product backlog items, or requirements
Reorder your backlog
Add details and estimates to your backlog items
Bulk update
Drag items to a sprint
Map backlog items within a hierarchy
Review the hierarchy or portfolio of work assigned to multiple teams
Forecast work
Display rollup progress, counts, or totals
About backlogs
７ Note
For more information, see Backlogs, boards, and plans. In case you don't see the
desired work items on your backlog or board, see Set up your backlogs and
boards.


# Page 613

Backlogs present work items as lists. A product backlog represents your project plan, the
roadmap for what your team plans to deliver. It also provides a repository of all the
information need to track and share with your team.
In Agile methodologies, a portfolio backlog lets you group and organize your backlog
into a hierarchy. You can display high-level initiatives, epics, or projects that your
organization plans to work on over a longer period of time. These initiatives are often
too large or complex to fit in the scope of a single team's backlog. They require
coordination and planning at a higher organizational level.
Each backlog is associated with a team and the team configuration settings determine
the work items that appear on the team backlog. The team administrator does the
following tasks for their team:
Select the Area Paths that are active for the team. Only work items assigned to
these area paths appear on the team's backlog.
Product and portfolio backlogs
Backlog configuration
７ Note
How do I add a backlog or board? You don't add backlogs or boards. You add a
team which is automatically configured with it's own set of backlogs and boards.
For more information, see About teams and Agile tools.


# Page 614

Set the default Area Path and Iteration Path used when defining work items from
the team backlog.
Select the Iteration Paths that are active for the team.
Determine which backlog levels are active for the team.
Define how bugs get treated, as requirements or as tasks.
For more information, see the following articles:
Define iteration (sprint) paths and configure team iterations
Define area paths and assign to a team
Select backlog levels
Show bugs on backlogs or boards
Question: Can you define a backlog configuration that multiple teams can subscribe to?
Answer: No. Each team controls their own team settings and backlog configurations.
Because each user can configure their own Column Options and View Options, there's
no way to configure a common backlog view for all teams. Also, there's no default
column options that can be set for each team.
Build your project plan by creating a backlog of work items. These items represent the
features, requirements, user stories, or other work to complete. Portfolio backlogs
provide support for organizing work in a hierarchical fashion. They help track major
product initiatives or scenarios that rely on many stories or requirements. Different types
of work items help you track different types of work, such as user stories, tasks, bugs,
and issues.
 Tip
Each team member has several tools to configure their backlog view:
Expand/Collapse one level, Column Options, Backlog level selector, View options,
and Filter toolbar. Options set for each backlog level are distinct and persist until
changed. For more information, see Configure your backlog view.
Common backlog configurations for multiple teams
Define work items and create your backlog


# Page 615

 
 
Where you add or move the items on the page determines the sequence of items on
each backlog. For more information, see Reorder your backlog.
As you drag items within the backlog list, a background process updates the Stack Rank
(Agile and Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) processes) or Backlog Priority
(Scrum process) fields. The system uses these fields to track the relative ranking of items
on the product, feature, epic, or other portfolio backlog. By default, these fields don't
appear on the work item form.
Don't use the bulk modify function to change the value of the backlog priority field.
While you can assign a value to these fields, you assign the same value to all items that
you select for bulk edit.
Backlog priority or stack rank order


# Page 616

The preferred method for bulk edit is to use multi-select to move items to the top,
bottom, or specific position within the page. If you must edit one of the backlog order
fields in bulk to get a large number of work items in the priority order you want, use
Excel. You can export a query that contains the backlog items, update either the Backlog
Priority or Stack Rank fields, and then publish your changes.
Backlogs are designed to display work that corresponds to a Proposed, In Progress, or
Resolved category state. When you complete work and its state enters a Done, or Closed
state, it falls off the backlog view. You can always create a query to view completed
work, or view the Recently completed pivot from the Work Items page. For more
information, see View and add work items.
In general, you display all items that are in the In Progress category state, which
corresponds to the Active and Committed states. To focus on work that is proposed but
not in progress, you can toggle the backlog view to turn off In Progress. This toggle is
useful when forecasting your product backlog.
If your backlog is missing items, check whether the In Progress view is turned off. For
more information, see Workflow states and state categories.
When you have many initiatives your teams are working on, you might want to group
the work according to these initiatives. By defining features and epics, you can group
your work into a three-tiered hierarchy consisting of epics, features, and backlog items.
For example, here the Customer Service team organized several backlog items under
two features and one epic.
In Progress items and work listed on the
backlog
Organize your backlog by mapping and
reparenting backlog items


# Page 617

When you assign your backlog items to sprints, you gain access to an in-context velocity
report for both product and portfolio backlogs. Velocity helps teams determine how
much work they can perform sprint-over-sprint.
You can configure the Velocity report to count work items or sum Story Points, Effort,
Remaining Work or other numeric field.
Velocity


# Page 618

For more information, see View and configure team velocity.
Product and portfolio backlogs support rollup columns. You can add one or more rollup
columns to display progress bars, counts of descendant work items, or totals of select
numeric fields. Your settings persist for each page that you customize and are only valid
for your views.
Progress bars indicate the percentage of descendant items within a hierarchy that
are closed or completed.
Counts display the total number of descendant items.
Totals provide a sum of numeric fields, such as Effort, Story Points, Completed
Work, or Remaining Work of descendant items.
The following example shows progress bars for a portfolio backlog.
Display rollup progress counts, or totals


# Page 619

When you have several teams, your hierarchical views can show items that belong to
other teams.
Your team's product backlog lists only those items whose area path matches items
assigned to your team. If you show parents, you see the parent epic of the features and
backlog items, even if another team owns the epic or feature.
Other team-owned items appear with an information icon 
 .
Work with multi-team ownership of backlog
items
View backlog items and parent items owned by other
teams


# Page 620

For more information, see Define area paths and assign to a team.
Here's another example that shows the Epics backlog for the Management team.
Drilling down, you can see all the backlog items and features, even though they belong
to one of three different teams: Customer Service, Phone, and Web.
 Tip
Add the Node Name field as a column to identify the area path/team associated
with the work items.
View epics and child items owned by other teams


# Page 621

From these views, you can reparent items that you own and items other teams own. You
can't reorder items that another team owns.
This organization enables management teams to focus on high-level features and epics,
and development teams to focus on just the backlog items they're responsible to
deliver. For example, you can create a team structure similar to this one with two
management and three development teams. For more information, see Create or add a
team.


# Page 622

For more information about hierarchical team and backlog structures, see Manage your
product and portfolio backlogs.
All backlogs and boards support dragging to reorder and reparent work items. Updates
made to one team's backlogs and boards are reflected in other team backlogs and
boards that share the same area path. You might need to refresh the page to view the
changes.
You can only use dragging to reorder or reparent work items assigned to area paths
selected for your team. When the Parents view option is enabled, work items might
appear on your backlog that your team doesn't own. Anything that appears with the 
information icon can't be reordered or reparented because another team owns it.
） Important
You have the flexibility to establish child links with work items from different
projects. However, if the processes differ between projects, the hierarchy won't be
visible on the backlog for those child items that reside in the separate projects.
Nonetheless, you can view all of the associated child items directly on the work
item form.
Reordering and reparenting work items


# Page 623

Sprint backlogs and Taskboards only show the last node in a same-category hierarchy,
called the leaf node.
You can create a hierarchy of backlog items, tasks, and bugs. We don't recommend that
you create same-category hierarchies. In other words, don't create parent-child links
among work items of the same type, such as story-story, bug-bug, or task-task.
The last node in a same-category hierarchy might only appear on boards, sprint
backlogs, and Taskboards. For example, if you link items within a same-category
hierarchy that is four levels deep, only the items at the fourth level appear on the board,
sprint backlog, and taskboard.
Rather than nest requirements, bugs, and tasks, we recommend that you maintain a flat
list. Create parent-child links one level deep between items that belong to a different
category. For more information, see Troubleshoot reordering and nesting issues.
You can use the following controls to change or filter your product backlog view.

Create your backlog in Azure Boards
Article • 10/16/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
The product backlog is your project plan, which shows what your team intends to
deliver. It contains user stories, backlog items, or requirements that you add to it. Your
backlog is a flat list of work items, as the following image illustrates, which shows a
Scrum process for Azure Boards. For the Agile, Basic, and Capability Maturity Model
Integration (CMMI) process models, the Backlog items selection appears as Stories,
Issues, and Requirements.
Project access: Be a project member.
Permissions:
Be a member of the Contributors or Project Administrators security group.

# Page 628

To view or modify work items, have your View work items in this node and Edit
work items in this node permissions set to Allow. By default, the Contributors
group has this permission set to Allow. For more information, see Set work
tracking permissions.
Access levels: To add or modify work items, have at least Basic access. Users with
Stakeholder access for public projects have full access to backlog and board
features, like users with Basic access. For more information, see Stakeholder access
quick reference.
Defined iterations: To use the Planning pane, ensure your team administrator
defined iteration (sprint) paths and configure team iterations.
If you have a project, you have a backlog. Your backlog contains a list of features and
requirements that you want to build, ordered by priority. By default, each project has a
team and a set of backlogs for that team. You can add more backlogs if you need to
support more teams. When you create a new team, you also create various team assets
that a team admin can customize to suit the team's workflow. To add a set of backlogs
to support a new team, see Create or add a team.
Each team's set of backlogs is associated with one or more work item types. The work
item type associated with a backlog depends on the process selected at project
creation, team configurations, and process customizations.
The backlogs defined for each default process are:
Agile: Stories, Features, and Epics
Basic: Issues and Epics
Scrum: Backlog items, Features, and Epics
CMMI: Requirements, Features, and Epics
To customize your backlogs with custom work item types, add portfolio backlogs, or
other supported options, see Inherited process model or On-premises XML process
model.
From your web browser, do the following steps to open your product backlog.
1. Sign in to your project
( https://dev.azure.com/{Your_Organization}/{Your_Project} ).
Add a backlog
Open your backlog


# Page 629

2. Select Boards > Backlogs.
To select a different backlog, choose a different team or select the View Backlog
directory option. You can also enter a keyword in the search box to filter the team
backlogs for the project.
 Tip
Choose the 
 star icon to favorite a team backlog. Favorited artifacts (
favorited icon) appear at the top of the team selector list.


# Page 630

3. Check that you selected Stories (for Agile), Issues (for Basic), Backlog items (for
Scrum), or Requirements (for CMMI) as the backlog level.
4. (Optional) To select which columns display and in what order, select the 
 actions
icon and Column options. For more information, see Change column options.
Some teams like to track bugs along with requirements on the backlog. Other teams like
to track bugs as tasks completed in support of a requirement, so bugs appear on their
Taskboard. Before you determine how to manage bugs, see Bugs as requirements or
tasks and Show bugs on backlogs and boards.
Your backlog shows work that you plan to do or that's in progress. As soon as the State
of a work item is set to Done or Completed, the work item doesn't appear on your
backlog. You can use the backlog controls to filter or change your view.
If you already defined a long list of items, you don't have to reenter them one at a time.
Instead, use bulk work items with CSV files or Microsoft Excel to import them to your
backlog.
1. Before you add work items, select 
 View options and turn the slider for Parents
and Forecasting to Off. Optionally, turn In Progress Items on or off.
 Tip
Each team member has several tools to configure their backlog view:
Expand/Collapse one level, Column Options, Backlog level selector, View options,
and Filter toolbar. Options set for each backlog level are distinct and persist until
changed. For more information, see Configure your backlog view.
Track bugs on your backlog
Convert ideas into backlog items


# Page 631

2. To add a work item, select 
 New Work Item and enter a title. Select Enter or
select Add to top. Work items are assigned the default Area Path and Iteration
Path selected for the team. For more information, see Manage and configure team
tools.
Depending on whether you create your project with Basic, Agile, Scrum, or CMMI, the
items in your backlog might be called issues, user stories, PBIs, or requirements. All of
these terms describe the customer value to be delivered and the work to be performed.
By default, user stories appear on Agile backlogs, issues on Basic backlogs, PBIs and
bugs appear on Scrum backlogs, and requirements appear on CMMI backlogs.
Reorder your items to create a prioritized list of work. Review and prioritize your backlog
frequently to help your team know what's most important to deliver next.
７ Note
If you have Stakeholder access, you can only add work items to the bottom of
the backlog. For more information, see Stakeholder access quick reference.
Reorder your backlog


# Page 632

You can't sort your backlog on a column. To view a sorted listed, select Create query.
Save and open the query, and sort the query results. For more information about
queries, see Use the query editor to list and manage queries.
To reorder your backlog, drag the work items. Or, if you prefer to use the keyboard, hold
down the Alt key and use the up and down arrows.
Backlogs that participate in portfolio management or that contain nested same-type
child items might not allow you to reorder the items. For more information, see these
articles:
Work with multi-team ownership of backlog items
Troubleshoot reordering and nesting issues
Building and prioritizing your backlog provides a high-level roadmap. Before your team
can start work on any item, however, they need more details. Capture the details within
the work item form.
To open each item, double-click or select Enter. Add all the information you want to
track. Change one or more field values, add a description, or make a note in the
Discussion section. You can also choose the 
 Attachments tab and drag a file onto it
to share the file with others.
Enter as much detail as the team needs to do the following tasks:
７ Note
To reorder a backlog, have at least Basic access. If you have Stakeholder access, you
can't reorder backlog items. For more information, see Stakeholder access quick
reference.
Add details and estimates to backlog items


# Page 633

Understand the scope
Estimate the work required
Develop tests
Ensure that the end product meets acceptance criteria
For example, here we assign the story to Raisa Pokrovskaya and we add a
discussion note, at-mentioning Raisa.
Select Save & Close when you're done.
７ Note
You can only assign work to a single user. If you need to assign work to more than
one user, add a work item for each user and distinguish the work to be done by
title and description. The Assigned To field only accepts user accounts that have
been added to a project or team.
Agile process


# Page 634

To plan a sprint, at a minimum, estimate the effort involved to implement each backlog
item. To capture effort in the work item form, use Effort for Basic or Scrum, Story Points
for Agile, or Size for CMMI.
Field
Usage
Effort, Story Points, Size
Provide a relative estimate of the amount of work required to complete a PBI. For user
stories and requirements, you capture estimates in Story Points and Size.
Most Agile methods recommend that you set estimates for backlog items based on
relative size of work. Such methods include powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8) and the Fibonacci
sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and so on). Use any numeric unit of measurement your team
prefers.
The estimates you set for Effort, Size, or Story Points are used to calculate velocity and
forecast sprints.
Business Value
Specify a priority that captures the relative value of a PBI compared to other PBIs. The
higher the number, the greater the business value.
Use this field when you want to capture a priority separate from the changeable backlog
stack ranking.
Description
Provide enough detail to create shared understanding of scope and support estimation
efforts. Focus on the user, what they want to accomplish, and why. Don't describe how
to develop the product. Do provide sufficient details so that your team can write tasks
and test cases to implement the item.
Acceptance Criteria
Define what Done means by describing the criteria for the team to use to verify whether
the PBI or the bug fix is fully implemented.


# Page 635

Before work begins on a PBI or bug, describe the criteria for customer acceptance as
clearly as possible. To determine the acceptance criteria, have conversations between
the team and customers. These criteria help ensure a common understanding within the
team to meet customer expectations. Also, this information provides the basis for
acceptance testing.
Impact Assessment (CMMI only)
Describes the customer impact of not implementing the requirement. You might include
details from the Kano model about whether this requirement is in the surprise, required,
or obvious categories.
From the View options selector, you can turn on In Progress Items. If you turn it off,
items that are in the Active, Committed, or Resolved states or states that map to the In
Progress category state don't appear in the backlog.
You'd likely choose to hide In Progress items when you want to forecast work. For more
information, see Forecast your product backlog.
Show or hide In Progress Items


# Page 636

From the View options selector, you can choose to show or hide Completed Child
items.
Choose to show Completed child items when you want to view rollup columns.
Choose to hide Completed child items when you want to forecast work. For more
information, see Forecast your product backlog.
Your product backlog is one of three classes of backlogs available to you, backlogs,
boards, and plans. If you don't see the work items you expect on your backlog, see Set
up your backlogs and boards.
Show or hide work items in Completed state
７ Note
Completed or closed work items don't display on the backlogs and boards after
their Changed Date value is greater than 183 days (about a half a year). You can
still list these items by using a query. If you want them to show up on a backlog or
board, you can make a minor change to them, which resets the clock.

Define features and epics to organize
your backlog
Article • 10/11/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
When you have a list of work items, it can be helpful to group related items into a
hierarchical structure. Do so by breaking down major features or scenarios into smaller
deliverables. If you have an existing backlog, you can organize it with features and epics.
For more information, see Organize your backlog and map child work items to parents.
Use portfolio backlogs to do the following tasks:
Bring more order to your backlog
Manage a portfolio of features that different development and management teams
support
Group items into a release train
Minimize size variability of your deliverables by breaking down a large feature into
smaller backlog items
Portfolio backlogs let you add and group items into a hierarchy. You can also drill up or
down within the hierarchy, reorder and reparent items, and filter hierarchical views.
Portfolio backlogs are one of three classes of backlogs available to you. For more
information, see Manage priorities and gain visibility across teams.
The following image shows a features portfolio backlog that consists of a flat list of
feature work items.
Portfolio backlogs


# Page 639

The following image shows the hierarchy for the Agile process backlog work item:
User Stories and tasks are used to track work.
Bugs track code defects.
Epics and features are used to group work under larger scenarios.
Each team can configure how they manage Bug work items at the same level as
User Story or Task work items. Use the Working with bugs setting. For more
information about using these work item types, see Agile process.
Project access: Be a project member
Permissions:
Be a member of the Contributors or Project Administrators security group.
Agile process
Prerequisites


# Page 640

To view or modify work items, have your View work items in this node and Edit
work items in this node permissions set to Allow. By default, the Contributors
group has this permission set to Allow. For more information, see Set work
tracking permissions.
Access levels: To add or modify work items, have at least Basic access. Users with
Stakeholder access for public projects have full access to backlog and board
features, like users with Basic access. For more information, see Stakeholder access
quick reference.
Defined iterations: To use the Planning pane, ensure your team administrator
defined iteration (sprint) paths and configure team iterations.
Epics and features are higher-level containers used to organize work. Typically, user
stories or backlog items roll up into features. Features roll up into epics. Keep this
hierarchy in mind when naming your features and epics.
Feature: A feature is a significant piece of functionality that delivers value to the
user. It usually includes several user stories or backlog items. A feature might take
one or more sprints to complete.
Epic: An epic is a large body of work that can be broken down into multiple
features. It represents a major initiative or goal. An epic might span several sprints
or even releases.
When you define features and epics, consider the time required to complete them.
Generally, you should complete backlog items, such as user stories or tasks, within a
sprint. Features and epics might take one or more sprints to complete.
To focus on one level of a backlog at a time, select the name of the backlog. You should
see three backlog levels: Epics, Features, and Backlog items. If you don't have these
values, see Select backlog navigation levels for your team.
1. Sign in to your project ( https://dev.azure.com/{Your_Organization/Your_Project} ).
2. Select Boards > Backlogs.
What makes a feature or epic?

Add details to a feature or epic


# Page 644

Field
Usage
Value Area
The area of customer value addressed by the epic, feature, or backlog item. Values
include:
Architectural—technical services to implement business features that deliver
solution
Business (Default)—services that fulfill customers or stakeholder needs that
directly deliver customer value to support the business
Effort
Story Points
Size
Provide a relative estimate of the amount of work required to complete a Feature or
Epic. Use any numeric unit of measurement your team prefers. Some options are story


# Page 645

points, time, or other relative unit. For more information, see Add details and estimates
to backlog items.
Business Value
Specify a priority that captures the relative value of an Epic, Feature, or backlog item
compared to other items of the same type. The higher the number, the greater the
business value. Use this field when you want to capture a priority separate from the
changeable backlog stack ranking.
Time Criticality
A subjective unit of measure that captures how the business value decreases over time.
Higher values indicate that the Epic or Feature is inherently more time critical than those
items with lower values.
Target Date
Specify the date by which to implement the feature.
You can add child items to your features from any backlog. You can also add child user
stories (Agile), or product backlog items (Scrum) or requirements (CMMI) from the
board for features. You can add child features from the Epic board. For more
information, see Board features and epics. To parent or reparent children from a
backlog, see Organize your backlog.
When you see the 
 Add icon, you can add a child item. The work item always
corresponds to the hierarchy of work item types defined for your project.
For more information, see Configure your backlog view and About work items and work
item types.
For Scrum projects, your hierarchy looks like the following example.
Add child items


# Page 646

For more information, see Show bugs on backlogs and boards and About default
processes and process templates.
To add a portfolio backlog or board, customize your process, add new work item types,
and then configuring your backlogs and boards. You can also add or modify the fields
defined for a work item type (WIT) or add a custom WIT. For more information, see
Customize an inheritance process and Customize your backlogs or boards (Inheritance
process).
Product and portfolio backlogs support rollup columns. You can add one or more rollup
columns to display progress bars, counts of descendant work items, or totals of select
numeric fields. Your settings persist for each page that you customize and are only valid
for your views.
Progress bars indicate the percentage of descendant items within a hierarchy that
are closed or completed.
Counts display the total number of descendant items.
Totals provide a sum of numeric fields, such as Effort, Story Points, Completed
Work, or Remaining Work of descendant items.
The following example shows progress bars for a portfolio backlog.

Organize your backlog and map child
work items to parents in Azure Boards
Article • 03/25/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
After you've added features or epics to your portfolio backlog, organize your backlog by
mapping backlog items. You can quickly add and group items into a hierarchy. And also
drill up or down within the hierarchy, reorder and reparent items, and filter hierarchical
views.
In this article you'll learn how to:
Project access: Be a project member
Permissions:
Be a member of the Contributors or Project Administrators security group.
To view or modify work items, have your View work items in this node and Edit
work items in this node permissions set to Allow. By default, the Contributors
group has this permission set to Allow. For more information, see Set work
tracking permissions.
Access levels: To add or modify work items, have at least Basic access. Users with
Stakeholder access for public projects have full access to backlog and board
features, like users with Basic access. For more information, see Stakeholder access
quick reference.
Defined iterations: To use the Planning pane, ensure your team administrator
defined iteration (sprint) paths and configure team iterations.

７ Note
For more information, see Backlogs, boards, and plans. In case you don't see the
desired work items on your backlog or board, see Set up your backlogs and
boards.
Prerequisites


# Page 649

From your web browser, open your product backlog.
1. (1) Check that you've selected the right project, (2) choose Boards>Backlogs, and
then (3) select the correct team from the team selector menu.
To select another backlog, open the selector and then choose a different team or
select the View Backlog directory option. Or, enter a keyword in the search box to
filter the list of team backlogs for the project.
７ Note
Stakeholder access users for a private project can't drag items to map or reparent
them or to assign their sprint.
Open your backlog from the web portal


# Page 650

2. Check that you have selected Stories (for Agile), Issues (for Basic), Backlog items
(for Scrum), or Requirements (for CMMI) as the backlog level.
3. (Optional) To choose which columns should display and in what order, choose the
 actions icon and select Column options. For more information, see Change
column options.
 Tip
Choose the 
 star icon to favorite a team backlog. Favorited artifacts (
favorited icon) appear at the top of the team selector list.
７ Note


# Page 651

You can set various options to view backlog work items using the View options menu.
To learn which options to set based on the tasks you want to accomplish, see Configure
your backlog view.
1. To view Parents or a tree hierarchy, choose the 
 view options icon and slide
Parents to On.
The images you see from your web portal might differ from the images you see in
this article. These differences result from updates made to your web app, options
that you or your administrator enabled, and which process was chosen when
creating your project: Agile, Basic, Scrum, or CMMI. The Basic process is available
with Azure DevOps Server 2019 Update 1
 and later versions.
Show parent tasks and expand the tree
hierarchy


# Page 652

The hierarchical view displays. From this view, you can reparent items by dragging
a child item to a new parent.
2. Use the  Expand and  Collapse icons to expand or collapse one level of the
hierarchy.
If you've already created your backlog, and now you want to organize it, you can do that
most easily by mapping child items to parents.
1. Choose 
 View options and select Mapping.
Map items to group them under a feature or
epic


# Page 653

The Mapping pane displays immediately.
2. Find Unparented backlog items that may appear at the end of the parented set of
backlog items. Parents must be turned on in view options.


# Page 654

3. To map features to epics, select the Features backlog from the backlog selector.
The Epics Mapping pane automatically displays.
You can multi-select backlog and sprint backlog items in the same way as you multi-
select items from query results.
It's the same process to map features to epics. From the Features backlog, drag features
to an epic listed under the mapping pane.
When you need to change the order or grouping, drag the item to its new location.
You can reparent an item using the mapping pane, or drag it within the hierarchy to
change its parent.
You can only reparent backlog items under other features, and features under other
epics.
Also, to change an item's priority within a group, drag the item up or down within its
hierarchical group. Reordering from a portfolio backlog works the same as when you
moved items into priority order on your product backlog.
Change the parent task and reorder items


# Page 655

If you find you can't reorder a backlog item, check whether the 
 info icon appears in
the first column as shown in the following image.
You can reparent items owned by other teams, but you can't reorder items owned by
other teams. For more information, see Backlogs, portfolios, and Agile project
management, Work with multi-team ownership of backlog items.
From a product or portfolio backlog, you can multi-select several work items and
choose Change parent… to link the items to a parent work item.

Interactively filter backlogs, boards,
queries, and plans in Azure Boards
Article • 11/22/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Filter functions in Azure Boards empower you to interactively apply one or more filters
to streamline your work item management. Each Azure Boards tool—such as Backlogs,
Boards, and Query results—comes prefiltered to display a relevant subset of work items
based on its specific functionality:
Backlogs and boards: Show work items based on the selected Area Paths and
Iteration Paths for your team.
Query results: List work items that match the query clauses you defined.
To enhance your filtering capabilities, enable the filter feature by selecting the 
 Filter
icon.
Even with these initial filters, you might still encounter a large number of work items.
Interactive filtering allows you to narrow down your view and focus on a specific subset
of work items by applying more filter criteria to each Azure Boards tool.
Filters can significantly enhance your workflow by helping you accomplish the following
tasks:
Daily scrum meetings: Focus the board on work assigned for a specific sprint to
facilitate effective stand-ups.
Sprints Taskboard: Filter to view a particular team member's completed work,
aiding in performance reviews and accountability.
Group work items: Concentrate on related work items by filtering based on Parent
Work Item, Area Path, or Tags, enhancing organization and clarity.
Triage work items: Create and apply queries to isolate similar work items grouped
by Area Path or Tags, enabling efficient issue resolution and backlog grooming.
Use cases for filters


# Page 659

By using these filter functions, your team can maintain focus, improve productivity, and
ensure that critical tasks receive the attention they deserve.
For more detailed information on using filters, see Filter Backlogs, Boards, and Plans.
Project access: Be a project member.
Filter functions are available from all Azure Boards tools: Work items, Boards, Backlogs,
Sprint Backlogs and Taskboards, Queries, and Delivery Plans. The set of features
supported depends on the tool and Azure DevOps version. (Use the content selector to
view the filters available for your version.)
The following table indicates the supported options based on the tool indicated with a
✔️ or is listed.
Backlogs and boards are subject to filters defined for the team as described in Set up
your Backlogs and Boards. Other tools have predefined filters based on the view, query
filter clauses, or settings you select.

Notes
1. While the Parent Work Item isn't a filter function for Backlogs or Query Results,
you can add the Parent field as a column and then do a keyword/phrase search on
the Parent title to effectively filter on parent work items. The Parent field is
supported for Azure DevOps Server 2020 and later versions. See also the Parent
field and Parent Work Item section later in this article.
2. The Parent Work Item filter is supported for Sprint Backlogs and Taskboards for
Azure DevOps Server 2020 and later versions.

Notes
1. The Work items page is subject to filters based on the view selected. Boards and
Backlogs are subject to filters defined for the team as described in Set up your
Backlogs and Boards. Completed and In Progress work items get determined
based on the state categories assigned to the workflow state as described in How
workflow states and state categories are used in Backlogs and Boards.
2. Grouping is supported through portfolio backlogs and boards, parent-child links,
and tree hierarchy. Tree hierarchies are flattened when filtering is applied and
reinstated when filtering is cleared.
3. Backlogs and Sprint Backlogs support reordering. However, when filtering is
enabled, reordering isn't supported.
4. Taskboards provides a Group by function based on People or Stories.
5. Query Results supports multi-column sort.
6. Work items appear in the order defined for the team Sprint backlog, which it
inherits from the team product backlog.
7. Semantic search supports sorting search results by the following fields—Assigned
To, Changed Date, Created Date, ID, State, Tags, Title, and Work Item Type—and
Relevance.
For more information about these other functions, see the following articles:
Reorder cards (boards)
Display rollup progress or totals
About backlogs, Work with multi-team ownership of backlog items


# Page 665

The Parent Work Item filter enables you to focus on one or more select features or
epics. This filter function was added in July 2016 and made available in Azure DevOps
Server 2017 and later versions.
The Parent field was added to Azure Boards in July of 2019 and then made available
with the release of Azure DevOps Server 2020. You can add the Parent field to a list
through the Column Options dialog, except for the Work items tool. You can also add
the Parent field to cards on the boards and Taskboards.
Once you set filter options for a specific view, your settings persist until you modify
them. There's no need to select a save button or take any other actions.
To filter work items based on specific fields, first add the field as a column or to the card.
For example, to filter by Assigned To, Iteration Path, Work Item Type, or any other
field's content, ensure these fields are displayed on the cards, backlog, plan, or list.
All filter configurations are user-specific and remain active until you clear them.
To add columns or fields, see the following articles:
For Backlogs and Queries, see Change column options
For Boards, see Customize cards
For Taskboards, see Customize a sprint Taskboard
For Plans, see Review team delivery plans.
1. From the Azure Boards tool, choose the view you want. For example:
For Work items, select Assigned to me, Following, Mentioned, or other view.
For Backlogs and Boards, select the backlog level you want, such as Stories,
Features, or Epics.
For sprint Backlogs and Taskboards, choose the iteration
For queries, define the query filter criteria of interest.

2. Choose any other view settings available for your view. For example:
For Work items, from the View options menu, enable/disable Completed
Work Items.
For Backlogs, from the View options menu, enable/disable In Progress items
or Completed Child items.
For Taskboards, from the Person menu, choose All, Unassigned, or a specific
team member.
3. For list views, add columns to display fields containing text you want to filter on or
possibly sort on. For card views, add fields to display on cards containing text you
want to filter on.
4. Select Filter 
 . Or, enter the Ctrl+Shift+f keyboard shortcut.
For example, here we open the filter toolbar for the board, Backlog items.
::: moniker-end
5. Choose your filters of interest.
The filter icon changes to a solid icon, Filter 
 , to indicate filtering is applied.
The page refreshes to show only those work items that meet all the selected filter
criteria.
When filtering is applied, the following functions are disabled or altered:
For backlogs, the add-a-backlog-item panel, reordering (stack ranking), and
forecasting tools are disabled.
For backlogs set to Show Parents, the tree hierarchy is flattened, unless you enable
the Keep hierarchy with filters from the View Options menu. See [Filter your
backlog and maintain the hierarchy](#keep hierarchy) provided later in this article.
To clear and dismiss filtering, choose Clear and dismiss filtering 
 .
Inactive functions
Clear or dismiss filtering


# Page 667

Filters remain in place until you explicitly clear them. When you refresh your backlog,
board, or other tool, or sign in from another browser, filters remain set to your previous
values.
Once the board is filtered, you can choose the filter icon to hide the drop downs and
view the applied filters on the board. The filter icon turns opaque to signify a filtered
board.
You can filter your backlog and maintain the hierarchy of work by choosing show
Parents and Keep hierarchy with filters from the View Options menu. Use these options
when you want to show work items assigned to one or more team members, work item
types, area or iteration paths, or combination of these items and keywords. The
hierarchy is maintained and work items that match the filter criteria are shown in bold
text.
Filter your backlog and maintain the hierarchy


# Page 668

Applying Boolean operators to filters is only supported for tags, as described in Filter
based on tags later in this article. All other filters are applied with an implicit AND
operator.
The keyword filter allows you to search lists or cards based on the fields configured
through Column Options or board settings. You can filter by specific values, such as IDs
even if the ID field is visible. When using the keyword filter, ensure that the fields
containing the desired text or tags are displayed in your view.
The filter criteria ignore the following characters: ,  (comma), .  (period), /  (forward
slash), and \  (back slash).
Here we filter the board to only show those cards that include 'web' either in the title,
tag, or field.

# Page 669

Here we filter the Backlog with Show Parents enabled, to only show work items that
include 'web'.
The filtered set is always a flat list, even if you selected to show parents.
With filtering turned on, choose one or more values from the multi-select drop-down
menu for each field available to you. The values for these fields are populated as follows:
Area: The Node Name, which specifies the last node of an Area Path, of valid Area
Paths and for which there are work items assigned to that Area Path
Assigned To: All users who are currently assigned to work items on the board plus
Unassigned
Iteration: All Iteration Paths selected for the current team and for which there are
work items assigned to that iteration
Work item type: Work item types defined for the Requirements Category (product
backlog) or Features or Epic categories (feature or epic portfolio backlogs), subject
to work items being assigned to the work item types
Tags: All tags assigned to work items on the board
Parent Work Items: All features defined for the team, or all epics defined for the
team when viewing the Features board

７ Note


# Page 670

You can filter by select field values using the board for your product backlog (Stories,
Product Backlog Items, or Requirements) or a portfolio backlog (Features or Epics).
For example, here we filter for all items assigned to Jamal and Raisa.
Cards are filtered based on the assignments made in the following order and logic:
1. Assigned to: Show all cards that are assigned to user 1 OR  user 2 AND
2. Iteration: Show all cards that are assigned to Iteration 1 OR  Iteration 2 AND
3. Work Item type: Show all cards that are work item type 1 OR  work item type 2 AND
4. Tags: Show all cards that have tag 1 AND  or OR  tags 2, based on your selection of
AND | OR . AND
5. Parent Work Items: Show all cards that have Parent Work Item 1 OR  Parent Work
Item 2.
Filter options are dependent on the work items that meet the filter criteria. For
example, if you don't have any work items assigned to Sprint 4, then the Sprint 4
option won't appear in the filter options for the Iteration Path.
The values that populate the filter options are based on the work items that are
currently loaded and displayed. For example, if you have a backlog with 2,000 work
items, but only 1,000 are displayed on a board, the filter options are based on just
the items displayed.
Filter a board by using select field values
Board filter logic


# Page 671

Here we show a filtered backlog based on the keyword "issues." Filtered pages show the
 filtered icon. The filtered set is always a flat list, even if you selected to show a
hierarchical backlog view.
You can use the Filter by parent feature to filter by select parent work items using the
board for your product backlog (Stories, Product Backlog Items, or Requirements) or a
portfolio backlog (Features).
Use this feature only when you created features or epics and linked them to user stories
or features, respectively. A quick and easy way to create the links is to map them using
drag-and-drop. Mapping creates parent-child links between the work items.
To start filtering, choose Filter 
 . Choose one or more values from the multi-select
drop-down menu for the Parent Work Item. These values are derived from the Features
you defined.
Here, we choose two features on which to filter the board:
Filter a backlog by using fields
Filter based on the Parent Work Item
７ Note
The Filter by parent feature doesn't support filtering of parent work items of the
same work item type. For example, you can't filter the Stories backlog by specifying
user stories that are parents of nested user stories.


# Page 672

The final board displays just those stories linked as child work items to the selected
features.
If you added tags to your work items, you can filter your work using one or more tags.
For backlogs and query results, add Tags as a column option before filtering on tags.
Check the boxes of those tags that you want to filter on. Keep the OR selection to do a
logical OR for all the tags you selected. Or, choose the AND option to do a logical AND
on all the selected tags.
Filter based on tags


# Page 673

For more information about tags, see Add tags to work items to categorize and filter
lists and boards.
In addition to all the filter features described earlier in this article, you can also filter the
history view within a work item form.
To quickly find revisions made that contain a keyword, or made by specific people or to
a specific field, enable the filter feature by choosing 
 Toggle filter.

Forecast your product backlog
Article • 11/27/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Teams use the forecast tool to help in their sprint planning efforts. By plugging in a
value for the team velocity, the forecast tool shows which items in the backlog can be
completed within future sprints. Both tools are team-specific tools that rely on the
team's ability to estimate backlog items. Once your team has completed a sprint or two,
they can use the team velocity to forecast how much of the backlog they can finish
within the upcoming sprints.
Use this article to learn:
Project membership: Member of a project.
Permissions: Member of the Contributors security group.
Access levels: At least Basic access.
Here's what you need to have in place before you attempt to forecast your team's
backlog.
How to forecast upcoming sprints
＂
Required and recommended team activities to support forecasting
＂
７ Note
For more information, see Backlogs, boards, and plans. In case you don't see the
desired work items on your backlog or board, see Set up your backlogs and
boards.
Prerequisites
７ Note
Users with Stakeholder access for a public project have full access to backlog and
board features just like users with Basic access. For more information, see
Stakeholder access quick reference.
Required and recommended activities


# Page 676

Required:
Define iteration paths (sprints) and configure team iterations
Sprints should be of the same duration.
Select enough future sprints to forecast your entire product backlog.
Define and estimate backlog items. If you work from your team's backlog, the
items you create automatically get assigned to the current sprint (Iteration) and to
your team's default Area Path.
Update the status of backlog items once work starts and when completed. Only
backlog items whose State maps to a state category of Proposed or In Progress
show up on the velocity chart. (For more information, see Workflow states and
state categories).
Recommended:
Define and size backlog items to minimize variability.
Determine how your team wants to treat bugs. If your team chooses to treat bugs
like requirements, bugs appear on the backlog and be counted within the Velocity
chart and forecasting.
Set your team's area path. The forecast tool forecasts those items based on your
team's default settings. These settings can specify to include items in area paths
under the team's default or exclude them.
Don't create a hierarchy of backlog items and bugs. The display of the leaf node,
the last node in a same-category hierarchy, may only appear on boards, sprint
backlogs, and Taskboards. For more information, see Fix reordering and nesting
issues, How backlogs and boards display hierarchical (nested) items.
Instead of nesting requirements, bugs, and tasks, maintain a flat list—only creating
parent-child links one level deep between different-category items. Use Features
to group requirements or user stories. You can quickly map stories to features. The
map creates parent-child links in the background.
At the end of the sprint, update the status of those backlog items that the team
has fully completed. Incomplete items should be moved back to the product
backlog and considered in a future sprint planning meeting.
７ Note
If you work with several teams, and each team wants to work with their own
backlog, velocity chart, and forecast tool, you can create additional teams. Each
team then gets access to their own set of Agile tools. Each Agile tool filters work
items to only include those whose assigned area paths and iteration paths meet
those set for the team.


# Page 677

Use the forecast tool to get an idea of how many items you can complete within a
sprint. By plugging in a velocity, you can see which items are within scope for the set of
sprints the team has activated.
To forecast your product backlog, complete the following actions.
1. (1) Check that you've selected the right project, (2) choose Boards>Backlogs, and
then (3) select the correct team from the team selector menu.
To select another backlog, open the selector and then choose a different team or
select the View Backlog directory option. Or, enter a keyword in the search box to
filter the list of team backlogs for the project.
Forecast upcoming sprints


# Page 678

2. Check that you have selected Stories (for Agile), Issues (for Basic), Backlog items
(for Scrum), or Requirements (for CMMI) as the backlog level.
3. (Optional) To choose which columns should display and in what order, choose the
 actions icon and select Column options. For more information, see Change
column options.
4. Choose the 
 view options icon and slide Forecasting to On. To keep things
simple, turn the Mapping and Planning panes Off.


# Page 679

Set In Progress Items to Off to hide those items that won't be counted in the
forecast. The forecast tool ignores Scrum items set to Committed or Done and
Agile and CMMI items set to Active, Resolved, or Completed.
5. Enter your team's predicted velocity.
The tool draws lines for each future sprint selected by the team. The Forecast lines
show how much work your team can complete in future sprints. Typically, items
above the first line are already in progress for the current sprint. Items that fall
between the first and second forecast lines indicate what can be completed in the
named sprint.
 Tip
If your team has been working for several sprints, you can gain an idea of your
team's velocity from the Velocity widget.


# Page 680

Check the results manually to understand discrepancies in what you expect and
what the forecast tool displays.
Check the amount of effort (Effort, Story Points, or Size) forecasted per sprint.
Question forecast results where the effort of an item is near to, or greater than,
team velocity.
In this example, a Velocity of 20 is used. The forecast tool limits the number of items
that are shown between the forecast lines to those items that can be completed within
the sprint or using unused velocity points from the previous sprint.
The forecast tool shows between two and four items can be worked on during Iterations
2 through 6 based on the number of Story Points you assigned to each user story or
bug. The forecast logic carries over velocity points from one sprint to the next.
Iteration 2: 13 Story Points, items 1 and 2 can be completed; 7 velocity points are
carried over to the next sprint
Iteration 3: 24 Story Points, items 3 through 5 can be completed; 3 (=20+7-24)
velocity points are carried over to the next sprint
Iteration 4: 21 Story points, items 6 through 8 can be completed; 2 (=20+3-21)
velocity points are carried over to the next sprint
Iteration 5: 16 Story points, items 9 through 12 can be completed; 6 (=20+2-16)
velocity points are carried over to the next sprint
Iteration 6: 23 Story points, items 13 through 16 can be completed; 3 (=20+6-23)
velocity points are carried over to the next sprint
Review the forecast results


# Page 681

Another way to use the forecast tool is to enter different velocity values until all the
backlog items are completed within a given set of sprints. This forecast provides an
estimate of what velocity is required to complete your backlog of items.
You can then assess the delta between the current team's velocity and the required
velocity. The delta helps determine what other resources are required to meet
production demands within a required time.

Configure your backlog view in Azure
Boards
Article • 11/22/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Backlogs in Azure DevOps are essential tools that support a wide range of project
management tasks. They enable teams to:
Define work to be done: Outline and document the tasks and deliverables
required for project completion.
Prioritize work: Order work items based on their importance and urgency to
ensure the most critical tasks are addressed first.
Organize work hierarchically: Group related tasks into parent-child relationships
for better structure and clarity.
Assign work to iterations: Allocate tasks to specific timeframes or sprints to
manage project phases effectively.
Forecast work: Predict project progress and identify potential bottlenecks to
maintain timely delivery.
Each backlog—whether it's a product or portfolio backlog—is a shared resource
accessible to all team members. When you add backlog items, set priorities, or establish
parent-child links between work items, these changes are instantly visible to the entire
team upon refreshing their backlog view.
To maximize the effectiveness of your backlog management, it's crucial to configure
your view options in a way that aligns with your team's workflow and project
requirements.
Project access: Be a project member
Permissions: Be a member of the Contributors group.
Access levels:
To reorder a backlog or use the Forecast tool, have at least Basic access. Users
with Stakeholder access can't reorder backlog items or use the Forecast tool.
For more information, see Stakeholder access quick reference.
Configured backlogs: Ensure that both product and portfolio backlogs are set up
for your team.
Prerequisites


# Page 684

You can customize your backlog view using the following tools:
Expand/collapse one level
Column options
Backlog level selector
View options
Filter toolbar
Each backlog level—such as stories, features, and epics (Agile process) or product
backlog items, features, and epics (Scrum process)—has its own set of configurable
options. These settings remain in effect until you decide to change them.
When you select a backlog level, it defaults to a collapsed view, displaying only the
items associated with that specific level. To view more details, use the  and  icons to
expand or collapse one level of the hierarchy. This action allows you to navigate through
the work item structure as needed. Your expand/collapse selections don't persist when
you switch to a different page or view.
 Tip
You can't sort your backlog directly by clicking on a column header. To view a
sorted list, select Create query from your backlog. Save and open the query, then
modify it to a flat list query if needed to apply sorting to the results. For more
information about queries, see Use the query editor to list and manage queries.
Backlog configuration options
Expand and collapse the hierarchy


# Page 685

The number of backlog levels available to you gets determined by your team
administrator and might include custom work item types or other backlog levels tailored
to your team's needs. Each backlog automatically applies the filters associated with the
Area paths and Iteration paths selected for the team.
From the Backlogs page, you can choose between a Product Backlog or a Portfolio
backlog. To select a backlog, use the backlog level selector located next to the 
 View
options icon. The labels within this selector vary based on the process model selected
for your project, any customizations made to that process, and configurations set by
your team administrator, as illustrated in the following images.
Agile process
Use backlog levels
７ Note
Before using the tools described in this article, we recommend reviewing Set up
your project's backlogs and boards to ensure your backlog configurations support
your team's requirements.

Use the view options menu


# Page 687

The 
 View options menu controls the following options.
Parents: Show the hierarchical grouping of parent-child work items. Useful when
adding child work items, reparenting a work item, or displaying rollup columns.
Forecasting: Show the Forecast tool and forecast lines. The Forecast option only
appears for the first-level backlog and depends on the assignment of Story points,
Effort, or Size.
In progress items: Show items whose workflow State corresponds to an In progress
workflow state category. If you turn the In progress control off, then items that are
in the Active, Committed, or Resolved states or a custom workflow state defined in
the In progress state category don't appear in the backlog. For more information
about category workflow states, see How to use workflow states and state
categories.
Completed child items: Show child items that are completed. Typically turn it On
when reviewing a rollup column.
Keep hierarchy with filters: Maintain the backlog hierarchy when filtering.
Mapping: Shows the Mapping pane to support drag-and-drop linking of work
items to parent items. The Mapping option doesn't appear when you select the


# Page 688

highest backlog level configured for your team.
Planning: Shows the Planning pane to support drag-and-drop of work items to
Iteration paths.
Enable filtering to locate specific work items based on criteria such as keywords, tags,
assignments, or other fields configured via Column options. To activate the filter feature,
select the 
 Filter icon.
When filtering is active, the backlog displays a flat list of all work items, even if Parents is
enabled to show hierarchical groupings. The hierarchical view is temporarily suspended
until you disable the filter toolbar. The filter toolbar remains visible until you close it.
For more information, see Filter backlogs, boards, and plans.
You can filter your backlog and maintain the hierarchy of work by choosing show
Parents and Keep hierarchy with filters from the View options menu.
Use the filter toolbar
Filter your backlog and maintain the hierarchy


# Page 689

Use these options when you want to show work items assigned to one or more team
members, work item types, area or iteration paths, or combination of these options and
keywords. The hierarchy is maintained and work items that match the filter criteria are
shown in bold text.
Efficiently adding work items allows you to capture tasks swiftly and refine their details
as more information becomes available. Utilize queries on your backlog to triage,
review, refine, and enhance work items added through your backlog.
1. Choose the backlog level where you want to add new work items.
2. From the View options menu, toggle the sliders for Parents and Forecasting to
Off, which simplifies the view by hiding hierarchical groupings and forecasting
tools.
Add work items quickly


# Page 690

3. (Optional settings:)
In progress items: Turn this option on or off based on whether you want to
display items currently in progress.
Column display: Minimize the number of columns shown on your backlog or
select specific fields you wish to display to streamline your view.
4. Add new work items:
Select the 
 New work item icon.
Enter a title for the work item.
Select Add to Top or Add to Bottom:
Recommendation: Add items to the bottom of the backlog if your team
prioritizes backlog items regularly.
Select Enter to add the work item.
Work items are automatically assigned the default Area path and Iteration path
configured for the team.
For more detailed instructions, see the following articles:
Create your product backlog
Define features and epics
If your team follows Agile or Scrum methodologies, prioritizing the backlog ensures that
the most important work items are addressed first. Follow these steps to effectively
prioritize your backlog:
1. Choose the backlog level you want to prioritize, for example, Stories, Features,
Epics.
７ Note
If you have Stakeholder access, you can only add work items to the bottom of
the backlog. For more information, see Stakeholder access quick reference.
Prioritize your product backlog


# Page 691

2. From the View options menu, turn the Parents view option Off to simplify the view
by hiding hierarchical groupings.
3. Reorder work items:
Drag and drop: Select and drag work items up or down within the backlog to
adjust their priority.
Keyboard shortcuts: Alternatively, hold down the Alt key and use the up and
down arrow keys to move work items.
Backlogs involved in portfolio management or containing nested same-type child items
might restrict the reordering of items. For more information, see the following articles:
Backlogs, portfolios, and Agile project management: Work with multi-team
ownership of backlog items
Fix reordering and nesting issues
The method for prioritizing a portfolio backlog is similar to that described for a product
backlog. The main difference is that you prioritize child items within each portfolio item.
７ Note
Changes you make to the priority of work items affect all team members. When
others refresh their backlogs, the updated priorities display. A background process
updates the Stack rank (Agile, Basic, and CMMI processes) or Backlog priority
(Scrum process) fields. These fields track the relative ranking of items in the
product, feature, epic, or other portfolio backlogs. By default, these fields do not
appear on the work item form. Priority ranking is assigned separately for each
backlog level, which you can verify by adding the field to a backlog and viewing it
in a hierarchical list.
Prioritize a portfolio backlog


# Page 692

Each backlog level—Stories, Features, Epics—supports priority ordering distinct from
every other level.
Prioritize the portfolio items:
1. Select the portfolio backlog level you want to prioritize.
2. Turn Off the Parents view option.
3. Drag the work items up or down within the backlog.
4. Within each item, you can expand to see child items and drag these items into
priority order.
Prioritize child items:
1. Expand each portfolio item.
2. Drag each child item up or down within the expanded item.
You can quickly link one or more work items to a parent portfolio item by dragging
them within your backlog view.
1. Choose the backlog level where you want to link work items, for example, Stories
to link to Features.
2. Select 
 View options.
3. Select Mapping to open the Mapping pane. By default, the pane lists the next-
level portfolio items for the current team.
4. (Optional) To map items to parent items owned by a different team, select the
desired team from the team selector in the Mapping pane.
Link work items to a parent (mapping)
 Tip
Before mapping work items, add and prioritize the portfolio backlog items you
want to link to. The Mapping pane lists portfolio backlog items in priority order.


# Page 693

5. Drag work items from the backlog and drop them onto the desired portfolio item
in the Mapping pane.
The system automatically creates a parent-child link. The backlog item's text turns
bold briefly as the system saves the changes.
You can select multiple work items to drag at once:
Sequential selection: Hold down the Shift key to select a range of items.
Non-sequential selection: Hold down the Ctrl key to select individual items.
Drag the selected items to create links.
6. (Optional) Within an expanded hierarchical view, you can also drag a work item to
a different parent to reparent it.
For more information, see Organize your backlog and map child work items to parents.
 Tip
To view work items that are unparented, add the Parent field as a column. The Title
of the parent item will be listed for work items that have been linked to a parent.


# Page 694

1. Select the portfolio backlog level, such as Features, that you want to add items to.
2. Select 
 Add User Story, Bug for the feature you want to add the child item to as
shown in the following image. Your labels might differ based on process and
customizations.
3. In the work item form that appears, enter a Title and any other required fields or
details. Save the work item to close it.
For more information, see Define features and epics, add child items.
1. Select the backlog level you want to inspect for unparented items.
2. Open View options and select Parents.
3. Scroll to the bottom of the backlog and expand Unparented Stories, Unparented
Features, or similar entries. Unparented work items are listed under these entries.
Similar to using the Mapping pane, you can use the Planning pane to assign one or
more work items to an Iteration path or sprint.
1. Ensure all Iteration paths are selected for your team that you want to show in the
Planning pane.
2. Choose the backlog level that contains the work items you want to assign.
3. Open View options, turn Off Completed child items and choose Planning.
4. Drag work items from the backlog to the portfolio item listed in the Mapping
pane. The system creates a parent-child link in the background. The backlog item
turns bold and then unbold as the system saves the changes.
You can select multiple backlog items and drag them to a portfolio item. To select
several items in a sequence, hold down the shift key. To select several
Add child items to a portfolio backlog item
View or find unparented work
Assign work to a sprint or iteration


# Page 695

nonsequential items, use the Ctrl key. Then, you can drag the selected items.
The Forecast tool is only available for the product backlog. To forecast your backlog, do
the following steps:
1. Ensure that future Iteration paths are selected for your team.
2. Choose the backlog level for your team.
3. (Optional) Add the Story points, Effort, or Size field as a column based on the
process your project uses.
4. Open View options and turn Off the Parents, In progress items, and Completed
child items. Turn On the Forecast option.
5. Enter a velocity estimate in the Forecasting based on velocity box.
6. Review the forecast lines that appear, similar to the ones shown in the following
image.
Forecast a backlog


# Page 696

The forecast tool doesn't reference any iteration assignments made to the product
backlog items.
For more information, see Forecast your product backlog.
Enhance your backlog view by adding rollup columns such as a Progress bar, Work item
count, or the Sum of any integer or numeric field. These columns let you:
Monitor progress: Visualize the completion status of parent work items based on
their child items.
Track workload: View the number of work items associated with each parent item.
Aggregate Data: Calculate the total value of numeric fields, for example, Story
Points and Effort, for better project tracking.
Parent work items can include:

Automate work item state transitions
Article • 09/09/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Automatically update the state of a work item according to the state of its child tasks.
For example, if one task is changed to Doing , then the parent gets set to Doing . And if
all tasks are in Closed  state, then the parent gets Closed .
Rules are established at the team backlog level and are applicable to all work items at
that specific level. You have the flexibility to establish these rules independently for each
backlog level, including stories, features, and epics. For example, you can automate the
closure of user stories, but keep features and epics open.
Permissions: To configure work item automation rules for your team, be a Team
Administrator or member of the Project Administrators group.
Do the following steps to set team rules for each backlog level.
1. Sign in to your project
( https://dev.azure.com/{Your_Organization}/{Your_Project} ).
2. Select Boards > Backlogs > 
 Configure team settings.
） Important
Work item automation rules exclusively pertain to your team’s workflow on the
backlog and boards. Other teams within your project can customize their own rules
to align with their specific work processes.
Prerequisites
Set rules
７ Note
Work items must belong to the same team; when you close a task in a different
team or project, it doesn't trigger the closure of the parent item.


# Page 700

3. Check one or more applicable boxes, which trigger the parent work items on this
backlog level, and then select Save.
Work item states are set to automatically transition when child items get updated
on your backlog.
Rules applied to sprint board
These rules operate seamlessly, regardless of where you make updates to the child
items, such as on the sprint board, for example.
Rules applied to the user stories backlog level
The following example shows the rules applied to the user stories backlog level.

Set up your project's backlogs and
boards in Azure Boards
Article • 11/22/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
In most cases, you can start using your product and portfolio backlogs once your
project is created. A default team gets created along with associated backlogs and
boards. You can start adding work items to your product backlog using the Backlog or
Board.
However, you might need to ensure you've configured your backlogs and boards
correctly. Ensure the configuration if you've added a team and want to start using the
team backlogs and boards. Changes may be made to a project or team configuration
over time. These changes can influence the work items that appear on your backlog and
boards.
For an overview of the tools associated with your team, see Manage and configure team
tools.
Project access: Be a project member
Permissions:
Be a member of the Contributors or Project Administrators security group.
To view or modify work items, have your View work items in this node and Edit
work items in this node permissions set to Allow. By default, the Contributors
group has this permission set to Allow. For more information, see Set work
tracking permissions.
Access levels: To add or modify work items, have at least Basic access. Users with
Stakeholder access for public projects have full access to backlog and board
features, like users with Basic access. For more information, see Stakeholder access
quick reference.
Defined iterations: To use the Planning pane, ensure your team administrator
defined iteration (sprint) paths and configure team iterations.
Prerequisites
Default backlog and board work items


# Page 704

The first thing you need to understand is that your product Backlog and Board display
work items that meet the following criteria:
Work item type belongs to the Requirements category. The types differ depending
on the process selected for your project:
Basic : Issue, Backlog name=Issues
Agile: User Story, Backlog name=Stories
Scrum: Product Backlog Item, Backlog name=Backlog items
CMMI: Requirement, Backlog name=Requirements
Work item Area Path matches one of the selected team's Area Paths
Work item Iteration Path is under the team's Default Iteration Path
You can determine the work item types that belong to your Requirements category.
Determine the items by opening your product Backlog and checking the product
backlog name.
Look up your team's Area Path(s) and Iteration Paths. For more information, see Define
area paths and assign to a team and Define sprint paths and configure team iterations.
Your sprint backlog and Taskboard apply the filters associated with your team's default
backlog and board work items along with the Iteration Path you select.
You can only select Iteration Paths that have been preselected by your team.
Your sprint backlog displays only those work items assigned to the selected sprint. Child
tasks assigned to other sprints aren't displayed.
If you don't see the work items you expect on your product Backlog or board, complete
the following checks:
Default sprint backlog and Taskboard work
items
Review checklist for work items, backlogs, and
boards


# Page 705

1. Make sure you've selected the team backlog or board of interest. To learn how, see
Use breadcrumbs and selectors to go to and open artifacts.
2. Create a query of your backlog items, specifying the work item types that belong
to your Requirements category and the Area Path associated with your team, for
example:
3. Add the State, Area Path, and Iteration Path fields to the column options.
4. Check the query results and that the values of the work items you expect to show
up on your backlog meet these criteria:
Area Path belongs to your team's area path(s)
Iteration Path belongs under your team's default iteration path
State isn't Closed, Completed, Done, or Removed.
For all processes except the Basic process, each team manages the way bugs are
tracked. Track bugs in the Requirements category because they show up on the Backlog
and board or the Tasks category. They can also show up on the Taskboard or the Bugs
category where they don't appear on either backlogs or boards.
７ Note
You can also filter your product backlog to show or hide work items that are in an
In Progress state category, corresponding to an Active, Resolved, Committed,
Doing workflow state.
Add bugs to your backlogs and boards
７ Note


# Page 706

If you want bugs to show up on your Backlog and Board, choose Bugs are managed
with requirements.
For more information, see Show bugs on backlogs and boards.
If you see the following error when you open your board, you need to correct the
configuration. The main reason for this error is that the workflow states of work item
types that have been added to the Requirements category aren't mapped to the
column.
Choose Correct this now to open the Settings dialog. To map the workflow states, refer
to Add columns to your board, Update column-to-State mappings.
Checklists are a great way to create work items that are automatically linked with a
parent-child link to another work item on a board. You can customize the work item
types that you can add as a checklist by opening the Board Settings, choose
Bug work item types aren't available with the Basic process. The Basic process
tracks bugs as Issues and is available when you create a new project from Azure
DevOps Services or Azure DevOps Server 2019.1
 or later versions.

more information, see Customize cards.
For example, here we've chosen to track bugs along with tasks, and enable Task, Bug,
GitHub objects, and Tests to appear within checklists.
For more information about checklists, see the following articles:
Add tasks or child items as checklists
Add, run, and update inline tests
Link GitHub commits, pull requests, branches, and issues to work items
If you added work item types to the Task Category as described in Add custom work
item types to your Taskboard later in this article, you can choose if these types appear
within a checklist on your product board. You make this choice by opening Board
Settings, choose Annotations, and enable the work item types you want to appear on

the board. You can enable up to five annotations. For more information, see Customize
cards.
For example, here we've chosen to track bugs along with tasks, and we enable Issue and
Ticket and Task and Bug. For more information about checklists, see Add tasks or child
items as checklists and Add, run, and update inline tests.
Your team can also choose to hide or show one or more backlog levels. Feature teams
often manage backlog items, while management teams manage features and epics. In
this situation, you can enable or disable a backlog level.
Hide or show backlog levels


# Page 709

For more information, see Select backlog navigation levels for your team.
If you want to track different work item types on your product backlog, you can do that
by adding custom work item types and adding them to a specific backlog level.
You can also add custom work item types and add them to portfolio backlogs. You can
add up to five portfolio backlogs.
For example, here we've added Initiatives, fourth level, and fifth level work item types to
support five levels of portfolio backlogs. We've also added a custom work item type
named Ticket and added that to the product backlog.
For more information, see the following resources:
Add and manage work item types (Inherited process)
Customize your backlogs or boards (Inherited process)
Add custom work item types to your backlogs
and portfolio backlog levels


# Page 710

Customize an inheritance process
To add custom work item types to appear on your sprint Taskboard, follow the steps
outlined next based on the process model your project uses.
For example, if you want to track a custom work item type, Tickets, along with Tasks and
Bugs, you do the following tasks:
1. Define the Ticket custom work item type. See Add and manage work item types.
2. Add the Ticket work item types to the Iteration backlog. For more information, see
Customize your backlogs or boards for a process.
The following settings can influence the type and number of work items that appear in
your backlogs and boards.
In your board, newly added work items may not appear if they're stack ranked
lower within the product backlog. By choosing Show more items, you can cause
the board to refresh and display more work items.
Add custom work item types to your Taskboard
７ Note
You can enable work item types that you add to your Iteration backlog to appear as
a checklist on your product board. To learn how, see Customize your board
checklist items provided earlier in this article.
Track custom work items with the Inherited process
model
Other factors that can affect work items in your
backlogs and boards


# Page 711

If you have nested work items that belong to the same category, only leaf nodes
may appear on the board (for TFS 2018.1 and earlier versions). For this reason, we
recommend that you don't nest work items of the same work item type or
belonging to the same category. For more information, see Fix reordering and
nesting issues, How backlogs and boards display hierarchical (nested) items.
If you've turned off the In Progress view, then those work items where work has
started won't appear in the backlog list.
Work items appear in the priority order in which they're added or moved to. This
order or sequence is managed by the Stack Rank (Basic, Agile, and CMMI
processes) or Backlog Priority (Scrum) field. For more information, see the Stack
rank section in Backlogs, portfolios, and Agile project management.
Each backlog can display up to 999 work items. If your backlog exceeds this limit,
then you may want to consider adding a team and moving some of the work items
to the other team's backlog.
Sprint backlogs show only those work items that meet the team's area path and
the Iteration Path defined for the sprint.

Each column corresponds to a work item field. You can add and remove columns within
work item lists to show the fields of interest to you. Or, you can drag a column to a new
position. Your settings persist for each page you customize and are only valid for your
views.
Specifically, you can do the following actions from the following list views:

You can add most fields listed in the Work item field index. All fields defined within the
project collection or organization are available for selection, even those fields that aren't
used for your particular project. You can view the list of fields defined for your collection
from Organization Settings>Process>Fields
Once you set the column options for a specific view, your settings persist until you
change them. The following notes apply to specific views.
Column options you set for a backlog apply only to the active team and backlog.
Options you set for the product backlog differ from the options you set for a
portfolio backlog.
 Tip
Unlike a query result, you can't sort a backlog by a column. However, you can use
the Create Query link on each backlog to create a query that you can sort on any
field column you choose from the Sorting tab of the Column options dialog. While
you may be able to add a field to sort on, not all fields are supported. For example,
selection of the Parent, History, Description, or other rich-text field results in the
display of an error message as you can't sort on these fields.

Azure Boards
Article • 09/17/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 | Azure DevOps Server 2020
This article provides an overview of rollup functionality in Azure DevOps, explaining how
rollup sums values of select fields for all child work items of a parent. Rollup is
commonly used for estimated or completed work, effort, size, or story points. However,
rollup of Effort, Story Points, or Size fields across product and portfolio backlogs isn't
supported. This article also guides you through the steps to implement rollup
functionality in various contexts such as product and portfolio backlogs, sprint Planning
pane, sprint backlogs, and taskboards.
In the following example, Progress by Work Items displays progress bars for parent
work items based on the percentage of closed descendant items. For Epics, descendant
items include all child Features and their child or grandchild work items. For Features,
descendant items include all child User Stories and their child work items.
） Important
Rollup data supports progress bars, counts of work items, and sums of
numeric fields within a project. Child items linked to a different project aren't
included in the parent rollup calculations.
Links to test cases or test artifacts aren't included in rollup calculations, as
these items are linked using test-specific link types.


# Page 721

Permissions: Be a member of the Project Collection Valid Users Group to view
delivery plans and rollup progress.
Access levels: Have one of the following access levels assigned to you:
Basic: Provides full access to all Azure Boards features, including viewing and
modifying work items.
Stakeholder: Allows viewing and modifying work items but with limited
features.
７ Note
You can view rollup progress in the new version of Delivery Plans, now available in
public preview for Azure Boards. This feature is integrated into Azure Boards and is
no longer an extension. To enable it, see Manage or enable features and turn on
New Delivery Plans Experience. For more information, see Review team Delivery
Plans.
Prerequisites


# Page 722

Use parent-child links: Ensure that your work items are linked using parent-child
relationships to support rollup.
Add required fields: Make sure that the fields you want to roll up are present in
the work item types.
The default set of backlog work items that supports natural hierarchical grouping varies
based on the process chosen for your project. The easiest way to create a hierarchy is by
mapping work items or adding them to a parent item on a board. For more information,
see Organize your backlog, map child work items to parents and Board features and
epics.
The following image shows the Agile process backlog work item hierarchy. Each
team can configure how they manage bugs—either at the same level as User
Stories or Tasks—by adjusting the Working with bugs setting.
Each user can customize their column options, and these settings persist across sessions
for each backlog.
1. Open a product or portfolio backlog. Optionally, enable Show parents in your view
options. Even if child items aren't listed, rollup for them displays.
Open a portfolio backlog and select In Progress Items and Completed Child Items. This
allows you to compare the State value of items with the rollup value.

For example, the following image shows that the Count of Tasks for the parent user
stories is 2 and 4, respectively. The Count of Tasks for the parent Feature and Epic
is 6.
2. Remaining Work of Tasks shows the sum of Remaining Work of tasks linked to the
parent item.
７ Note
The menu options vary based on the process chosen for your project, the
selected backlog level, and whether the Show parents view option is enabled.

Use the following methods to get rollup data:
Create flat list queries:
Create a flat list query to include the fields you want to roll up.
Export the query results to Excel for further analysis.
Use extensions:
Install extensions from the Azure DevOps Marketplace that support rollup
functionality.
Example: Roll-up Board
 extension.
Use the Analytics Service:
Use the Analytics Service to create custom reports and dashboards that include
rollup data.
Example: Create a Power BI report that displays rollup values for your work
items.
1. Got to your product or portfolio backlog.
2. Ensure that the backlog view includes the fields you want to roll up.
The rollup values display in the backlog view.
1. Open the sprint planning pane.
2. Add the fields you want to roll up to the view.
The rollup values display for the parent work items.
1. Go to your sprint backlog or taskboards.
2. Ensure that the view includes the fields you want to roll up.
The rollup values display for the parent work items.
When a task is closed, the Remaining Work field automatically sets to zero.

Rollup data gets calculated from the Analytics service. When dealing with a large
amount of data, you might experience some latency in displaying rollup. Hover over the
 rollup icon to determine the state of the data.
If an error occurs in retrieving rollup data, you see an 
 info icon and empty rows.
Errors indicate when the Analytics data was last updated, meaning the Analytics services
are still processing changes that might affect rollup calculations. Once the Analytics data
is up to date, the rollup columns refresh with the latest data.
For more information about the service, see What is Analytics?.
To change the order of the fields, drag and drop the field to your desired position within
the set of selected fields. To remove a field, select the

Show bugs on backlogs and boards
Article • 11/12/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
As your team identifies code defects or bugs, they can add them to the backlog and
track them similar to tracking requirements. You can schedule bugs to be fixed within a
sprint along with other tasks.
When you track bugs as requirements, they appear on the product Backlogs and boards.
When you track bugs as tasks, the bugs appear on Sprint Backlogs and Taskboards. For
more information about other work item types, see Add other work item types to
backlogs or boards.
You can define your team's tracking setting for the Agile, Scrum, and Capability Maturity
Model Integration (CMMI) processes. The Bug work item type isn't defined for the Basic
process, so there isn't a team setting for Basic. Instead, you should track bugs and code
defects using the Issue work item type.
Permissions: Be a team administrator or a member of the Project Administrators group.
The following table summarizes the options teams have for tracking bugs. Before you
make your choice, we recommend you review the information provided in Define,
capture, triage, and manage bugs, which provides an overview of the Bug work item
type and supported tools for managing bugs.
Option
７ Note
Requirements specify expectations of users for a software product. In Azure Boards,
requirements are defined by work items that appear on your product backlog.
Based on the process selected for your project, requirements correspond to User
Story (Agile), Product backlog item (Scrum), Issue (Basic), or Requirement (CMMI)
work item types. They also belong to the Requirements category, which manages
the work item types that appear on the product backlog.

items can appear on your backlogs and boards. To learn more about how nested items
are treated, see Troubleshoot reordering and nesting issues.
Bugs are a common item that teams want to track, and choose how they track them. For
more information, see Manage bugs.
However, what if you want to track other work item types on your backlogs and boards?
You can add other work item types by customizing your process or project, based on the
process model that you use. These items include change requests, issues, and
impediments.
For the Inheritance process model, see Customize your backlogs or boards.
For Hosted XML and On-premises XML process models, see Add a work item type
to a backlog and board.
For an overview of process models, see Customize your work tracking experience.
Bugs that are managed with requirements can be added through the product backlog
or board. When bugs are managed along with tasks, you can add them to a sprint
Nest items
 Tip
If, after refreshing a backlog or board, you don't see bugs where you expect to see
them, review Troubleshoot reordering and nesting issues. Only leaf nodes of
nested items appear on the or task boards.

Set up your project's backlogs and
boards in Azure Boards
Article • 11/22/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
In most cases, you can start using your product and portfolio backlogs once your
project is created. A default team gets created along with associated backlogs and
boards. You can start adding work items to your product backlog using the Backlog or
Board.
However, you might need to ensure you've configured your backlogs and boards
correctly. Ensure the configuration if you've added a team and want to start using the
team backlogs and boards. Changes may be made to a project or team configuration
over time. These changes can influence the work items that appear on your backlog and
boards.
For an overview of the tools associated with your team, see Manage and configure team
tools.
Project access: Be a project member
Permissions:
Be a member of the Contributors or Project Administrators security group.
To view or modify work items, have your View work items in this node and Edit
work items in this node permissions set to Allow. By default, the Contributors
group has this permission set to Allow. For more information, see Set work
tracking permissions.
Access levels: To add or modify work items, have at least Basic access. Users with
Stakeholder access for public projects have full access to backlog and board
features, like users with Basic access. For more information, see Stakeholder access
quick reference.
Defined iterations: To use the Planning pane, ensure your team administrator
defined iteration (sprint) paths and configure team iterations.
Prerequisites
Default backlog and board work items


# Page 742

The first thing you need to understand is that your product Backlog and Board display
work items that meet the following criteria:
Work item type belongs to the Requirements category. The types differ depending
on the process selected for your project:
Basic : Issue, Backlog name=Issues
Agile: User Story, Backlog name=Stories
Scrum: Product Backlog Item, Backlog name=Backlog items
CMMI: Requirement, Backlog name=Requirements
Work item Area Path matches one of the selected team's Area Paths
Work item Iteration Path is under the team's Default Iteration Path
You can determine the work item types that belong to your Requirements category.
Determine the items by opening your product Backlog and checking the product
backlog name.
Look up your team's Area Path(s) and Iteration Paths. For more information, see Define
area paths and assign to a team and Define sprint paths and configure team iterations.
Your sprint backlog and Taskboard apply the filters associated with your team's default
backlog and board work items along with the Iteration Path you select.
You can only select Iteration Paths that have been preselected by your team.
Your sprint backlog displays only those work items assigned to the selected sprint. Child
tasks assigned to other sprints aren't displayed.
If you don't see the work items you expect on your product Backlog or board, complete
the following checks:
Default sprint backlog and Taskboard work
items
Review checklist for work items, backlogs, and
boards


# Page 743

1. Make sure you've selected the team backlog or board of interest. To learn how, see
Use breadcrumbs and selectors to go to and open artifacts.
2. Create a query of your backlog items, specifying the work item types that belong
to your Requirements category and the Area Path associated with your team, for
example:
3. Add the State, Area Path, and Iteration Path fields to the column options.
4. Check the query results and that the values of the work items you expect to show
up on your backlog meet these criteria:
Area Path belongs to your team's area path(s)
Iteration Path belongs under your team's default iteration path
State isn't Closed, Completed, Done, or Removed.
For all processes except the Basic process, each team manages the way bugs are
tracked. Track bugs in the Requirements category because they show up on the Backlog
and board or the Tasks category. They can also show up on the Taskboard or the Bugs
category where they don't appear on either backlogs or boards.
７ Note
You can also filter your product backlog to show or hide work items that are in an
In Progress state category, corresponding to an Active, Resolved, Committed,
Doing workflow state.
Add bugs to your backlogs and boards
７ Note


# Page 744

If you want bugs to show up on your Backlog and Board, choose Bugs are managed
with requirements.
For more information, see Show bugs on backlogs and boards.
If you see the following error when you open your board, you need to correct the
configuration. The main reason for this error is that the workflow states of work item
types that have been added to the Requirements category aren't mapped to the
column.
Choose Correct this now to open the Settings dialog. To map the workflow states, refer
to Add columns to your board, Update column-to-State mappings.
Checklists are a great way to create work items that are automatically linked with a
parent-child link to another work item on a board. You can customize the work item
types that you can add as a checklist by opening the Board Settings, choose
Bug work item types aren't available with the Basic process. The Basic process
tracks bugs as Issues and is available when you create a new project from Azure
DevOps Services or Azure DevOps Server 2019.1
 or later versions.

For example, here we've chosen to track bugs along with tasks, and we enable Issue and
Ticket and Task and Bug. For more information about checklists, see Add tasks or child

Your team can also choose to hide or show one or more backlog levels. Feature teams
often manage backlog items, while management teams manage features and epics. In
this situation, you can enable or disable a backlog level.
Hide or show backlog levels


# Page 747

For more information, see Select backlog navigation levels for your team.
If you want to track different work item types on your product backlog, you can do that
by adding custom work item types and adding them to a specific backlog level.
You can also add custom work item types and add them to portfolio backlogs. You can
add up to five portfolio backlogs.
For example, here we've added Initiatives, fourth level, and fifth level work item types to
support five levels of portfolio backlogs. We've also added a custom work item type
named Ticket and added that to the product backlog.
For more information, see the following resources:
Add and manage work item types (Inherited process)
Customize your backlogs or boards (Inherited process)
Add custom work item types to your backlogs
and portfolio backlog levels


# Page 748

Customize an inheritance process
To add custom work item types to appear on your sprint Taskboard, follow the steps
outlined next based on the process model your project uses.
For example, if you want to track a custom work item type, Tickets, along with Tasks and
Bugs, you do the following tasks:
1. Define the Ticket custom work item type. See Add and manage work item types.
2. Add the Ticket work item types to the Iteration backlog. For more information, see
Customize your backlogs or boards for a process.
The following settings can influence the type and number of work items that appear in
your backlogs and boards.
In your board, newly added work items may not appear if they're stack ranked
lower within the product backlog. By choosing Show more items, you can cause
the board to refresh and display more work items.
Add custom work item types to your Taskboard
７ Note
You can enable work item types that you add to your Iteration backlog to appear as
a checklist on your product board. To learn how, see Customize your board
checklist items provided earlier in this article.
Track custom work items with the Inherited process
model
Other factors that can affect work items in your
backlogs and boards


# Page 749

If you have nested work items that belong to the same category, only leaf nodes
may appear on the board (for TFS 2018.1 and earlier versions). For this reason, we
recommend that you don't nest work items of the same work item type or
belonging to the same category. For more information, see Fix reordering and
nesting issues, How backlogs and boards display hierarchical (nested) items.
If you've turned off the In Progress view, then those work items where work has
started won't appear in the backlog list.
Work items appear in the priority order in which they're added or moved to. This
order or sequence is managed by the Stack Rank (Basic, Agile, and CMMI
processes) or Backlog Priority (Scrum) field. For more information, see the Stack
rank section in Backlogs, portfolios, and Agile project management.
Each backlog can display up to 999 work items. If your backlog exceeds this limit,
then you may want to consider adding a team and moving some of the work items
to the other team's backlog.
Sprint backlogs show only those work items that meet the team's area path and
the Iteration Path defined for the sprint.

Rollup of work and other fields
Article • 09/16/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Rollup provides summed values of selected fields for all child work items of a parent.
Since Azure DevOps supports multiple levels of nesting, ensure you don't double-count
values during rollup. Project managers typically seek rollup for estimated or completed
work, effort, size, or story points.
Azure Boards supports rollup columns on product and portfolio backlogs, rollup within
the sprint Planning pane, as well as rollup on sprint backlogs and taskboards.
From any product or portfolio backlog, you can add rollup progress bars, counts of
descendant work items within a hierarchy, or sum of select fields, such as Story Points or
Remaining Work.
For example, see the following progress bars for a portfolio backlog.
７ Note
The system doesn't support rollup of the Effort, Story Points, or Size fields across
product backlogs and portfolio backlogs.
Native support of rollup within the web portal
Display rollup progress bars, counts, or totals


# Page 752

For more information, see Display rollup progress or totals.
As you assign backlog items to a sprint using the Planning pane, the sprint window
updates with a running tally of the number of backlog items and tasks, as well as the
Planned Effort.
Planned Effort provides a sum of all Story Points or Effort defined for backlog items
assigned to the sprint. For more information, see Assign backlog items to a sprint.
In addition, you can view rollup of Remaining Work from a sprint backlog or taskboard.
From the sprint backlog, the sum of all Remaining Work defined for all tasks is
displayed for the parent work item. This value also displays on the parent work item card
when you view the task board.
From a sprint task board, there are three types of rollup:
View rollup within sprint Planning pane
View rollup of sprint backlogs and taskboards


# Page 753

The rollup of Remaining Work displays on the card for the parent work item
The sum of all Remaining Work defined for all tasks within a column displays at the
top of each column
The sum of all Remaining Work defined for all tasks for a backlog item displays
within each row, grouped by column.
When you update the status of a task as Completed, the system automatically zeros out
the Remaining Work for that task. For more information, see Task board.
You can obtain rollup of additional data fields in Azure DevOps work tracking data by
using one of the following methods:
Method
Azure DevOps Services
On-premises Azure DevOps
Work item query charts
Microsoft Excel
Marketplace extensions
Other tools that support rollup
ﾉ

You can create a flat list query that sums the values of a field you specify. For more
information, see Track progress by creating status and trend query-based charts. Charts
support a count of work items or a sum of a field.
For example, here we show a pivot table that sums the story points for user stories by
area path and work item state.
You can export a query to Excel that contains the work items you want to provide rollup.
You can then write an Excel macro to get the sums and publish data back to TFS. For
more information about Excel integration, see Bulk add or modify work items with Excel.

There are several extensions available from the Marketplace
 that provide rollup. Here
are a few that may support your needs:
VSTS Rollup
, supports Azure DevOps Services only
TFS Aggregator
, supports Azure DevOps Services and TFS
Or, you can write an extension using the REST API for work tracking to get rollup. A code
sample available on github that can get you started is TFS Aggregator
.
You can use the Analytics Service to answer quantitative questions about your projects.
With this service, you can add Analytics widgets to your dashboard. Or, you can create
additional reports using Power BI.
To support rollup, structure your work items according to the following
recommendations:
Use parent-child links to link work items that contain values that you want to
rollup.
Add required fields to the WITs that will capture the rollup values. Default fields
used to schedule work are only present on the task work item. These fields are:
Original Estimate (Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.OriginalEstimate): The amount of
work required to complete a task. (Agile and CMMI)
Completed Work (Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.CompletedWork): The amount of
work that has been spent implementing a task. (Agile and CMMI)
Remaining Work (Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.RemainingWork): This field is used
to support burndown charts.
To provide support for opening work items and query results in Excel from the web
portal, add the VSTS Open in Excel

View and configure team velocity
Article • 08/13/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Velocity metrics provide useful information, so teams can plan and forecast sprints and
determine how well they estimate and meet planned commitments. You can get an
indication of how much work a team can complete during a sprint based on either a
count of work items completed or the sum of estimates made for effort (product
backlog items), story points (user stories), or size (requirements). Use velocity as an aid
to determine team capacity and don't confuse it with key performance indicators.
Project membership:
You must be a member of a project. Get added to a project or create one.
Team membership and permissions:

configuration dialog.
Modify the title, select the team, and then select either the backlog level or work
item type to track. Select whether you want to track a count of work items or a
sum of a numeric field. The most common summed field is that of Effort, Story
Points, or Size.


# Page 763

2. Specify the number of sprints you want to view. The default is 6 and the maximum
is 15.


# Page 764

3. (Optional) Select the check boxes to show additional information for work
completed later than planned for each sprint.
Display planned work for iterations: Check this box to display the amount of
work planned for an iteration at the start of the iteration, which is useful for
comparing your planned work to actual deliverables. By default, the count of
planned work begins on the start date of the iteration.
Days past start date of iteration when planned work is final: Specify the
number of days past the start date for counting planned work. For example, if
the first two days of an iteration are for planning, then you can enter 3 , and
planned work gets counted on the third day. For example, if the iteration
starts on 01/01/2024 , and three backlog items are assigned to the iteration
on 01/01/2024  end-of-day, then those three backlog items are considered as
Planned. If your team doesn't complete planning until a few days into the
iteration, then you can update the Days past start date of iteration when
planned work is final.
Highlight work completed late: Check this box to display work items marked
complete after the iteration end date, which is considered to be completed
late and show as light green. Highlighting work completed late is useful for
spotting a trend where work items are marked complete after the iteration is
complete.
Days past end date of iteration after which work is late: Specify the number
of days past which you consider a work item late if its status is still new or is
in progress. For example, entering three days gives the team 3 days after the
end of an iteration to mark work items complete or done, before considered
late.
4. Select Save. The following image shows Velocity based on Story Points and eight
sprints of data.

For more information about Planned, Completed, Completed Late, and Incomplete
states, see the State descriptions mentioned earlier in this article.
For your team to gain the greatest utility from the Velocity charts, follow these required
and recommended tasks.
Define iteration paths (sprints) and configure team iterations. Ensure sprints are of
the same duration.
Define and estimate backlog items. Items created from the team's backlog are
automatically assigned to the current sprint and the team's default Area Path.
Update the status of backlog items when work starts and completes. Only items
with a State of In Progress or Done appear on the Velocity chart or widget.
Define and size backlog items for minimized variability.
Decide how your team treat bugs. If treated like requirements, bugs appear on the
backlog and are included in the Velocity chart and forecasting.
Required and recommended tasks for using
Velocity charts
Required tasks
Recommended tasks


# Page 766

Set your team's area path. The forecast tool forecasts these settings to include or
exclude items in area paths under the team's default.
Avoid creating a hierarchy of backlog items and bugs. The board, Taskboards, and
sprint backlog only show the last node in a hierarchy. Instead, maintain a flat list
with parent-child links one level deep. Use Features to group requirements or user
stories.
Update the status of completed backlog items at the end of the sprint. Move
incomplete items back to the product backlog for future sprint planning.
Minimize the size variability of backlog items for improved estimation accuracy.
Reducing variability increases the reliability of velocity metrics and forecast results.
Estimates are best guesses by the team regarding the effort required to complete
an item relative to others on the backlog.
If each team wants their own backlog view, Velocity chart, and forecast tool, you can add
a new team. Each team has access to its own set of Agile tools, which filter work items to
include only the assigned area paths and iteration paths specific to that team.
Forecast your sprints
Set dashboard permissions
Define iteration paths (sprints) and configure team iterations
Configure a burndown or burnup widget
） Important
Deleting Area Paths or reconfiguring Iteration Paths causes irreversible data loss.
For example, burndown and burnup widget charts, sprint burndown, and velocity
charts for teams with changed Area Paths don't show accurate data. Historical
trend charts reference the Area Path and Iteration Path as defined at the time for
each work item. Once deleted, historical data for these paths can't be retrieved.

Implement Scrum practices for your
team in Azure Boards
Article • 09/10/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Your Sprints tools include a filtered backlog based on an Iteration Path and a similarly
filtered taskboard. These tools are useful for implementing Scrum practices. With Scrum,
you can schedule and plan sprints, update your taskboard, and monitor your sprint
burndown.
Scrum methods use Iteration Paths, also referred to as sprints, to plan work to for a
team within a specific time period and cadence. To get started, several sprints are
predefined for your team. If you're new to Scrum, get an overview from What is Scrum?.
The general sequence of steps for implementing Scrum using Azure Boards is as follows:
1. Define project-level Iteration Paths and set dates
2. (Optional) Add project-level Area Paths (Or, add an area path when you configure
each team)
3. Add teams
4. Select team-level Iteration Paths.
1. Create and organize your team backlog.
2. (Optional) Forecast your team backlog.
７ Note
For more information, see Backlogs, boards, and plans. In case you don't see the
desired work items on your backlog or board, see Set up your backlogs and
boards.
Use Azure Boards to implement Scrum
1. Configure teams and sprints
2. Create team backlog

4. Adjust work to fit sprint capacity
5. (Optional) Share your sprint plan
6. Update the Taskboard
7. Monitor your sprint burndown
1. End of sprint activities
2. Sprint retrospective meetings
Sprint backlogs and Taskboards provide a filtered view of work items a team assigned to
a specific iteration path, or sprint. Sprints are defined for a project and then selected by
teams. From your backlog, you can map work to an iteration path using drag-and-drop,
and then view that work in a separate sprint backlog.
3. Implement a sprint
Close out a sprint
Sprint backlogs and Taskboards overview


# Page 770

Each sprint that you select for your team provides access to a sprint backlog, taskboard,
and other Agile tools for planning and tracking work.
1. Gain an overview of your sprint planning by turning on the Planning view option.
From the product backlog or any sprint backlog, choose the 
 view options icon
and select Planning.
How selected sprints show up on the backlog
７ Note
The Planning pane only shows the current sprint and the next 10 future
sprints in the list, even if more have been selected for the team.


# Page 771

The set of sprints selected for your team appears. If you don't see any sprints
listed, you can add sprints or select existing sprints for your team's use. To learn
how, see Define sprints.
2. To select a sprint backlog, you can choose one of the sprint links from the
Planning pane, or from a Sprint backlog, choose a sprint from the sprint selector.
Once you define iteration (sprint) paths and configure team iterations, you can start
using the following tools to plan your sprint.
At the start of each sprint, plan the work that your team can commit to. The three Agile
tools that support this work include the sprint backlog, capacity planning, and capacity
bars. The sprint backlog contains a filtered subset of backlog items whose iteration path
corresponds to the current sprint.
By setting team capacity, the team knows exactly the total number of work hours or
days the team has for each sprint. With this tool, you set individual team member
capacity and days off. And, conveniently, you can set holidays or shared days off taken
by the entire team.
Track team capacity
Team capacity planning tool


# Page 772

Setting capacity for each team member working during a sprint causes the capacity bar
for that individual to appear.
For more information, see Set capacity for the team and team members.
With capacity bars, you can quickly see who is over, at, or under capacity. Capacity bars
update with each of these activities:
Tasks are assigned with nonzero remaining work
Change in remaining work
Date change within the sprint cycle. Individual and team capacity always reflects
their capacity from the current day until the end of the sprint.
Individual and team capacity bars

Here's how to interpret the capacity colors:
During a sprint, use the taskboard and sprint burndown chart to track their progress.
Your sprint burndown chart provides you with an at-a-glance visual to determine if your
team is on track to meet their sprint plan.
Taskboard
Your Taskboard provides an interactive progress board for work required to complete
the sprint backlog. During your sprint, update the status of tasks and the remaining
work for each task.
Updating tasks daily or several times a week yields a smoother burndown chart.
Sprint burndown chart
Update tasks and monitor burndown


# Page 774

Use the sprint burndown chart to mitigate risk and check for scope creep throughout
your sprint cycle. The burndown chart reflects the progress made by your team in
completing all the work they estimated during their sprint planning meeting.
The ideal trend line always indicates a steady burndown. The blue area, however,
represents what's actually going on. It shows the buildup of work as team members add
tasks and the reduction of work as team members complete those tasks.
Use sprint planning and tracking tools for each sprint. Also, use the velocity and forecast
tools to estimate work that can be completed in future sprints.
Velocity provides a useful metric for gaining insight into how much work your team can
complete during a sprint cycle. And, the forecast tool provides a means for determining
how much work your team can complete within a sprint. This amount is based on a
specified team velocity.
After several sprints, use the Velocity chart and Forecast tool tool to estimate work that
can be accomplished in future sprints.
Velocity chart
Each team is associated with one and only one velocity chart. The green bar within the
Use velocity and forecast tools to predict work
effort


# Page 775

chart indicates the total estimated effort (story points or size) of backlog items (user
stories or requirements) completed within the sprint. (Blue corresponds to the estimated
effort of items not yet completed.)
Velocity varies depending on team capacity, sprint over sprint. However, over time, the
velocity should indicate a reliable average that can be used to forecast the full backlog.
By minimizing the variability of backlog item size—effort or story points—you gain more
reliable velocity metrics.
Forecast tool
Use the forecast tool to get an idea of how many and which items you can complete
within a sprint.
By plugging in a velocity, you can see which items are within scope for the set of sprints
the team selected. As shown here, a velocity of 15 indicates that it takes three sprints to
complete the work shown.*


# Page 776

There isn't a sprint scope change chart or widget. But, you can query for work items
added to a sprint or moved out of a sprint after the start of the sprint. Use the steps
provided next.
1. Open the velocity chart for the team and choose the Planned bar for the sprint of
interest. Use the Planned bar for a velocity chart widget or the team backlog

Manage sprint timelines
Article • 01/09/2025
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
With Scrum, teams plan and track work at regular time intervals, referred to as a sprint
cadence. You define Iteration Paths, also referred to as sprints, to support the
assignment of work items to time-box intervals. Iteration paths are a shared resource
used by all teams that select them. Many teams choose a two or three week cadence.
You can, however, specify shorter or longer sprint cycles. Or, you can create a release
schedule that encompasses several sprints.
Permissions: To change sprint dates, be a member of the Project Administrators
security group, or have the Edit this node permission for the iteration child node you
want to change. By default, the user who created the project has these permissions set.
For more information, see Change project-level permissions or Set permissions and
access for work tracking.
To quickly get started, you can use the default sprints. Default sprints are also referred to
as iterations and were added when your project was created. Note, be a member of the
Project Administrators group to add sprints and schedule sprint dates. If you created
the project, you're a member.
1. From your web browser, open your team's sprint backlog. (1) Check that you've
selected the right project, (2) choose Boards>Sprints, (3) select the correct team
from the team selector menu, and lastly (4), choose Backlog.
 Tip
If all you need is to change the iteration dates, you can do that by following the
guidance provided in this article. However, if you need to define the iteration paths
and tree structure, or assign team sprints, then follow the guidance provided in
Define iteration paths (sprints) and configure team iterations.
Prerequisites
Start scheduling sprints


# Page 781

2. To choose another team, open the selector and select a different team or choose
the 
 Browse all sprints option. Or, you can enter a keyword in the search box to
filter the list of team backlogs for the project.
3. Choose Set sprint dates.
4. Choose the calendar icon to select the start date, and then the end date of the
sprint.


# Page 782

5. Choose Save and close. You'll see the date listed.
That's it! You can now start planning your first sprint.
If you have several teams, more complex release and sprint cadences to schedule, or
want to create child iterations, then read further. You define these items through the
settings context for the project. See Define iteration (sprint) paths and configure team
iterations.
７ Note
Terminology note: Your set of Agile tools uses the Iteration Path field to track
sprints and releases. When you define sprints, you define the picklist of values
available for the Iteration Path field. You use iterations to group work into sprints,
milestones, or releases in which they'll be worked on or shipped.


# Page 783

Your project comes with several sprints predefined. However, they aren't associated with
any dates. For Scrum and sprint planning, assign start and end dates for your team's
sprints.
Defining other sprints is a two-step process. You first define the sprints for your project
and then you select the sprints for each team to use—Define iteration (sprint) paths and
configure team iterations. In this way, the system supports teams that work on different
sprint cadences.
Each sprint that you select for your team provides access to a sprint backlog, taskboard,
and other sprint planning tools for planning and tracking work.
For example, by selecting Sprints 1 through 6, the Fabrikam Fiber team gets access to six
sprint backlogs. They also get access to capacity planning tools and a taskboard for each
sprint.
Schedule new sprints for different teams and
release cadences
７ Note
Your sprint backlog and taskboard are designed to support your Scrum processes.
In addition, you have access to product and portfolio backlogs and boards. For an
overview of the features supported on each backlog and board, see Backlogs,
boards, and plans.

Forecast your product backlog
Article • 11/27/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Teams use the forecast tool to help in their sprint planning efforts. By plugging in a
value for the team velocity, the forecast tool shows which items in the backlog can be
completed within future sprints. Both tools are team-specific tools that rely on the
team's ability to estimate backlog items. Once your team has completed a sprint or two,
they can use the team velocity to forecast how much of the backlog they can finish
within the upcoming sprints.
Use this article to learn:
Project membership: Member of a project.
Permissions: Member of the Contributors security group.
Access levels: At least Basic access.
Here's what you need to have in place before you attempt to forecast your team's
backlog.
How to forecast upcoming sprints
＂
Required and recommended team activities to support forecasting
＂
７ Note
For more information, see Backlogs, boards, and plans. In case you don't see the
desired work items on your backlog or board, see Set up your backlogs and
boards.
Prerequisites
７ Note
Users with Stakeholder access for a public project have full access to backlog and
board features just like users with Basic access. For more information, see
Stakeholder access quick reference.
Required and recommended activities


# Page 786

Required:
Define iteration paths (sprints) and configure team iterations
Sprints should be of the same duration.
Select enough future sprints to forecast your entire product backlog.
Define and estimate backlog items. If you work from your team's backlog, the
items you create automatically get assigned to the current sprint (Iteration) and to
your team's default Area Path.
Update the status of backlog items once work starts and when completed. Only
backlog items whose State maps to a state category of Proposed or In Progress
show up on the velocity chart. (For more information, see Workflow states and
state categories).
Recommended:
Define and size backlog items to minimize variability.
Determine how your team wants to treat bugs. If your team chooses to treat bugs
like requirements, bugs appear on the backlog and be counted within the Velocity
chart and forecasting.
Set your team's area path. The forecast tool forecasts those items based on your
team's default settings. These settings can specify to include items in area paths
under the team's default or exclude them.
Don't create a hierarchy of backlog items and bugs. The display of the leaf node,
the last node in a same-category hierarchy, may only appear on boards, sprint
backlogs, and Taskboards. For more information, see Fix reordering and nesting
issues, How backlogs and boards display hierarchical (nested) items.
Instead of nesting requirements, bugs, and tasks, maintain a flat list—only creating
parent-child links one level deep between different-category items. Use Features
to group requirements or user stories. You can quickly map stories to features. The
map creates parent-child links in the background.
At the end of the sprint, update the status of those backlog items that the team
has fully completed. Incomplete items should be moved back to the product
backlog and considered in a future sprint planning meeting.
７ Note
If you work with several teams, and each team wants to work with their own
backlog, velocity chart, and forecast tool, you can create additional teams. Each
team then gets access to their own set of Agile tools. Each Agile tool filters work
items to only include those whose assigned area paths and iteration paths meet
those set for the team.


# Page 787

Use the forecast tool to get an idea of how many items you can complete within a
sprint. By plugging in a velocity, you can see which items are within scope for the set of
sprints the team has activated.
To forecast your product backlog, complete the following actions.
1. (1) Check that you've selected the right project, (2) choose Boards>Backlogs, and
then (3) select the correct team from the team selector menu.
To select another backlog, open the selector and then choose a different team or
select the View Backlog directory option. Or, enter a keyword in the search box to
filter the list of team backlogs for the project.
Forecast upcoming sprints


# Page 788

2. Check that you have selected Stories (for Agile), Issues (for Basic), Backlog items
(for Scrum), or Requirements (for CMMI) as the backlog level.
3. (Optional) To choose which columns should display and in what order, choose the
 actions icon and select Column options. For more information, see Change
column options.
4. Choose the 
 view options icon and slide Forecasting to On. To keep things
simple, turn the Mapping and Planning panes Off.


# Page 789

Set In Progress Items to Off to hide those items that won't be counted in the
forecast. The forecast tool ignores Scrum items set to Committed or Done and
Agile and CMMI items set to Active, Resolved, or Completed.
5. Enter your team's predicted velocity.
The tool draws lines for each future sprint selected by the team. The Forecast lines
show how much work your team can complete in future sprints. Typically, items
above the first line are already in progress for the current sprint. Items that fall
between the first and second forecast lines indicate what can be completed in the
named sprint.
 Tip
If your team has been working for several sprints, you can gain an idea of your
team's velocity from the Velocity widget.


# Page 790

Check the results manually to understand discrepancies in what you expect and
what the forecast tool displays.
Check the amount of effort (Effort, Story Points, or Size) forecasted per sprint.
Question forecast results where the effort of an item is near to, or greater than,
team velocity.
In this example, a Velocity of 20 is used. The forecast tool limits the number of items
that are shown between the forecast lines to those items that can be completed within
the sprint or using unused velocity points from the previous sprint.
The forecast tool shows between two and four items can be worked on during Iterations
2 through 6 based on the number of Story Points you assigned to each user story or
bug. The forecast logic carries over velocity points from one sprint to the next.
Iteration 2: 13 Story Points, items 1 and 2 can be completed; 7 velocity points are
carried over to the next sprint
Iteration 3: 24 Story Points, items 3 through 5 can be completed; 3 (=20+7-24)
velocity points are carried over to the next sprint
Iteration 4: 21 Story points, items 6 through 8 can be completed; 2 (=20+3-21)
velocity points are carried over to the next sprint
Iteration 5: 16 Story points, items 9 through 12 can be completed; 6 (=20+2-16)
velocity points are carried over to the next sprint
Iteration 6: 23 Story points, items 13 through 16 can be completed; 3 (=20+6-23)
velocity points are carried over to the next sprint
Review the forecast results


# Page 791

Another way to use the forecast tool is to enter different velocity values until all the
backlog items are completed within a given set of sprints. This forecast provides an
estimate of what velocity is required to complete your backlog of items.
You can then assess the delta between the current team's velocity and the required
velocity. The delta helps determine what other resources are required to meet
production demands within a required time.

1. Assign backlog items to a sprint in
Azure Boards
Article • 03/25/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
The first step in planning your sprint is to assign work from your backlog to a sprint.
Your team builds the sprint backlog during the sprint planning meeting, typically held
on the first day of the sprint. Each sprint corresponds to a time-boxed interval that
supports your team's ability to work using Agile processes and tools. During the
planning meeting, your product owner works with your team to identify those stories or
backlog items to complete in the sprint.
Here's an example of a sprint plan that consists of backlog items and the tasks required
to complete each item. By setting team capacity and estimating tasks, the team can see
when the team or a team member is at, under, or over capacity.
In this article you'll learn how to:
７ Note
Your project comes with several predefined sprints. You can quickly add more
sprints from your backlog as needed. Or, change the dates of the predefined
sprints. To learn more about sprints, also referred to as iterations, see About areas
and iterations.


# Page 794

Planning meetings typically consist of two parts. In the first part, the team and product
owner identify the backlog items that the team feels it can commit to completing in the
sprint, based on experience with previous sprints. These items get added to the sprint
backlog. In the second part, your team determines how it develops and tests each item.
They then define and estimate the tasks required to complete each item. Finally, your
team commits to implementing some or all of the items based on these estimates.
Project access: Be a project member.
Permissions:

７ Note
Sprint planning doesn't need to be challenging. It can be fun and a time for the
entire Scrum team to build camaraderie by working together to answer the
question of "What can we commit to?" For examples and strategies to keep your
sprint planning focused and effective, check out the What is Scrum?.
When you've completed your sprint plan, your sprint backlog should contain all the
information your team needs to successfully complete work within the time allotted
without having to rush at the end.
Prerequisites

Before you start planning your sprint, you'll want to have created, organized, and
estimated your backlog.
Also, you'll want to have set the start and end dates for your sprint.
You can quickly assign work items to a sprint through drag-and-drop from the product
backlog to the sprint.
1. The next step is to open the Planning pane. Choose the 
 view options icon and
select Planning. While you're at it, make sure Parents and Forecasting are Off. You
can choose to set In Progress items to On or Off.
The set of sprints selected for your team appears. If you don't see any sprints
listed, you can add sprints or select existing sprints for your team's use. To learn
how, see Define sprints.
2. You can drag and drop items from the Backlog onto a sprint.
７ Note
The Planning pane only shows the current sprint and the next 10 future
sprints in the list, even if more have been selected for the team. Only a team
administrator or member of the Project Administrators group can select
iterations for a team.


# Page 798

3. Select one or more items from the backlog and drag them to the sprint you're
planning. This action updates the Iteration Path of the backlog items and any of its
child tasks to the sprint you selected.
4. Check the level of effort displayed in the sprint window. As you assign backlog
items to a sprint, the sprint window updates with a running tally of the number of
backlog items and tasks and the Planned Effort.
Planned Effort provides a sum of all Story Points or Effort defined for backlog items
assigned to the sprint. This sum represents your initial guess at the amount of
work your team completes in the sprint. Next, you'll define tasks, estimate that
work, and use your team's capacity to make sure it fits in the sprint.
Multi-select of work items on the product and sprint backlogs works in the same way as
multi-select works within query results.
With multi-select, you can complete several actions on several work items at once, such
as:
Move to a sprint
Use the multi-select feature to modify items in
bulk

Add tasks to backlog items for sprint
planning
Article • 11/27/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Adding tasks to backlog items is essential for tracking the work required to implement
them. Tasks also help estimate the effort assigned to individual team members and the
team as a whole. The capacity tool indicates how much work your team can commit to.
To effectively compare capacity with planned work, define and estimate tasks for each
backlog item.
Define comprehensive tasks:
Add as many tasks as needed to capture all aspects of completing each backlog
item.
Tasks can represent various activities such as design, coding, testing, content
creation, or sign-offs.
Assign and estimate effort:
Individual tasks: Team members typically add their own tasks and set estimates
for their workload.
Initial tasks: Alternatively, a development lead can define the initial tasks for a
story or requirement.
When you add and manage tasks, your team gains a clear understanding of the
importance and required effort for each item. This action ensures better workload
distribution and project planning.
Project access: Be a project member.
Permissions:
Be a member of the Contributors or Project Administrators security group.
To view or modify work items, have your View work items in this node and Edit
work items in this node permissions set to Allow. By default, the Contributors
group has this permission set to Allow. For more information, see Set work
tracking permissions.

To choose another team, open the selector and select a different team or choose
the 
 Browse all sprints option. Or, you can enter a keyword in the search box to
filter the list of team backlogs for the project.
2. To choose a different sprint than the one shown, open the sprint selector and
choose the sprint you want.

The system lists only those sprints selected for the current team focus. If you don't
see the sprints you want listed, then choose New Sprint from the menu, and then
choose Select existing iteration. For more information, see Define iteration (sprint)
paths.
If you don't have any work items assigned to a sprint, see 1. Assign backlog items to a
sprint.
If you added work items and they don't appear in your sprint backlog, check their area
and iteration paths.
The Area Path must match one of the areas assigned to the team
The Iteration Path must match the iteration of the sprint that you selected.
For details on assigning iteration paths to teams, see Define Iteration Paths and
configure team iterations.
If you added task work items, but they don't appear as a child of a product backlog
item, you can parent them from the sprint backlog.
Unparented tasks assigned to the selected sprint appear at the top of the backlog under
the Unparented group. Drag and drop the task on top of the work item you want to
parent it to.

If you don't have any backlog items assigned to your sprint, do that now. Also, set the
start and end dates for your sprint.
For each sprint backlog item, add a task. Adding tasks from the sprint backlog or board
automatically links the task to its parent backlog item.
You can add tasks from the sprint Backlog or Taskboard. All items you add automatically
get assigned to the Iteration Path of the selected sprint.
From the Backlog view, choose the plus sign to open the work item form for a task.
Add tasks to backlog items
 Tip
You can quickly add several tasks on the taskboard by simply entering a title. You
can then later bulk edit items to assign them or add additional details. You can also
enter Remaining Work onto the card by making sure you add that field to display
on the taskboard.


# Page 804

Complete the form as described in the next section.
Another option is to open the Taskboard, and add tasks as cards. Select the 
 plus
icon, enter a title for the item, and then press Enter on your keyboard.
To interactively filter sprint views, choose Filter 
 , and then specify a keyword or select
a value for a field or tag. For more information, see Interactively filter backlogs, boards,
queries, and plans.
 Tip
You can quickly add tasks through the Taskboard by just specifying the title of the
work item. To show fields on the card, see Customize a sprint Taskboard.


# Page 805

Name the task and enter an estimate for Remaining Work. Also, if you know who's doing
the work, assign the task to that team member.
At the planning stage, Remaining Work corresponds to an estimate of how long it takes
to complete the task.
A good rule of thumb is to size tasks to take no more than a day to complete. If a task is
too large, the team should break it down. In some cases, you might not estimate some
tasks effectively until other tasks get completed. Create the task now, but estimate it
when you have enough information.
During the sprint, team members update remaining work to continually reflect the time
required to complete the task. This value can actually increase after work begins. For
example, after working 4 hours on a task that was estimated to take 8 hours, you realize
you need 16 hours over what you estimated. You would update the Remaining Work
field with 20 (8-4+16). As you complete a task, you might find that more time is
required. Always update the task with your best estimate of remaining work. That way,
you help accurately reflect the total amount of work remaining in the sprint.
Field
Usage
Complete the task form


# Page 806

Original Estimate
The amount of approximate work required to complete a task. Typically, this field
doesn't change after it gets assigned.
You can specify work in hours or in days. There are no inherent time units associated
with this field.
Remaining Work
The amount of work remaining to complete a task. As work progresses, update this field.
It's used to calculate capacity charts and the sprint burndown chart. You can specify
work in any unit of measurement your team chooses.
Completed Work
The amount of work spent implementing a task.
Activity
Select the type of activity this task represents when your team plans sprint capacity by
activity.
Tasks without links to parent backlog items or user stories appear at the top of the
Taskboard. You can track unparented tasks in similar ways to other tasks. You can also
drag them to an existing backlog item to parent them. The unparented card tracks the
total of remaining work defined for all unparented tasks. However, it isn't associated
with any work item.
Unparented tasks


# Page 807

Unparenting a work item removes its association with a parent backlog item or user

3. Determine and set sprint capacity in
Azure Boards
Article • 11/27/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
While velocity correlates to how your team estimates requirements, capacity correlates
to actual task time. Time is calculated in either hours or days. Capacity takes into
consideration the variation in work hours by team members. It also considers holidays,
vacation days, and nonworking days.
Because days off and time available for each team member might vary from sprint to
sprint, set capacity for each sprint. The capacity tool helps you make sure your team isn't
overcommitted or undercommitted for the sprint. As you work day-to-day, you see if
your team is on track.
In this article, learn how to do the following tasks.
To set up sprints yet for your team, see Manage sprint timelines.
Project access: Be a project member.
Permissions: Be a member of the Contributors or Project Administrators security
group in your project. To get added, see Add users to a project or team.
Access levels: To view or set capacity, have at least Basic access. Users with
Stakeholder access can't view or set capacity. For more information, see
Stakeholder access quick reference.
The values displayed for Activity (Agile, Basic, or Scrum) or Discipline (Capability
Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)) reflect a union of all values defined for the Activity
or Discipline fields in all projects within the organization.

Prerequisites
About the Activity or Discipline pick-list items


# Page 810

To change the Activity or Discipline menu selections, see Add and manage fields.
Most teams specify capacity in hours. You can also specify it in days or any other units
your team chooses. For example, 0.5 days would correspond to 4 hours for a typical 8
hour day. Choose the same unit your team uses to estimate and track their time. For
example, the entries they make to the Original Estimate or Remaining Work fields. For
more information, see Fields used to estimate and track work.
1. From your web browser, open your product backlog. Check that you selected the
right project. Select Boards > Sprints, select the correct team from the team
selector menu, and choose Capacity.
To choose another team, open the selector and select a different team or choose
the Browse all sprints option. You can enter a keyword in the search box to filter
the list of team backlogs for the project.

2. To choose a different sprint than the one shown, open the sprint selector and
choose the sprint you want.
The system lists only those sprints that are selected for the current team focus. If
you don't see the sprints you want listed, then choose New Sprint from the menu,
and then choose Select existing iteration. For more information, see Define
iteration (sprint) paths.
From the Capacity page, you can add team members, enter the team time off, and set
capacity and days off for each team member.
Set capacity for the team and team members


# Page 812

1. If you don't see your team members listed, add them. Choose the 
 action icon
and select Add all team members. For this feature to work, users must be added
to the team.
The Add all team members action retrieves a maximum of 100 team members. If
you have more team members to add, you can add them one-by-one by choosing
Add user.
2. If you need to add other contributors to your project, choose the 
 Add user.
3. Set team member time off. For the entire team days off, choose the 0 days link as
shown.
In the Days off for dialog, select the start and end days during the sprint for the
team member or team days off.
 Tip


# Page 813

4. Set the Activity/Discipline and Capacity per day for each team member. If you
track capacity simply by team member, you can leave the Activity or Discipline
selection unassigned.
For example, Christie Church's capacity is 6 hours/day for design work.
By copying the capacity from the previous sprint, you save time. With the basics defined,
all you have to do is adjust the capacity based on individual and team days off and
capacity allocation per activity.
Only the capacity-per-day value and activity value are copied over. Individual and team
days off remain unset. The copy operation always copies the latest updates made to the
previous sprint. So you can repeat the copy operation if you made changes to the
previous sprint that you want to copy to the latest sprint.
Your sprint planning and tracking tools automatically consider days off when
calculating capacity and sprint burndown. You only have to indicate planned
days off for the team. For more information, see Set capacity for the team
and team members.
Copy capacity planning from the previous
sprint


# Page 814

To remove a user, choose the option from the users 
 action menu. This action doesn't
remove the user from the team.
As you define tasks and estimate the work, capacity charts start to fill in for each team
member. Capacity bars track the remaining work against the capacity for each team
member and the entire team.
You also see a roll-up of the remaining work required to complete each requirement or
bug.
Remove a user from capacity
Review capacity charts


# Page 815

From this view, you can see which individuals are at or near capacity. Teams can
determine if work needs to be moved out of the sprint or to reassign tasks.
 Tip
Define tasks that take a day or less to complete. This helps mitigate the risks that
come from poor estimates.
Also, don't divide tasks into subtasks. If you do divide a task into subtasks, specify
Remaining Work only for the subtasks, as the system rolls up summary values to
the parent task.
Track capacity when completing multiple
activities


# Page 816

Because individual team members have different sets of skills and duties, you can track
their activity and capacity for each activity and for each sprint.
Here, Jamal divides time between Deployment and Development.
If you work on more than one team, specify your sprint capacity for each team. For
example, both Christie and Raisa split their time between the Web and Phone teams. As
such, give 3 hours a day to the Web team, and 3 hours a day to the Phone team.

Adjust work to fit sprint capacity
Article • 03/25/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Check your team's capacity after you've defined all the tasks for all the sprint backlog
items. You can consider adding more items onto the sprint if your team is under
capacity. If over capacity, you'll want to remove items out of the backlog.
Next, check whether any team member is under, at, or over capacity. Or, if someone
hasn't even been assigned any work. Use the capacity bars to make these
determinations. If you haven't yet set capacity for your team, do that now.
Use this article to learn how to:
Project access: Be a project member.
Permissions:
Be a member of the Contributors or Project Administrators security group.
To view or modify work items, have your View work items in this node and Edit

Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Adding tasks to backlog items is essential for tracking the work required to implement
them. Tasks also help estimate the effort assigned to individual team members and the
team as a whole. The capacity tool indicates how much work your team can commit to.
To effectively compare capacity with planned work, define and estimate tasks for each
backlog item.
Capture all work: Add as many tasks as needed to fully capture the work required
to complete each backlog item.
Differentiate work types: Represent various activities such as design, coding,
testing, content creation, or sign-offs with separate tasks.
Assign responsibility:
Individual tasks: Team members typically add their own tasks and set estimates
for their workload.
Initial tasks: A development lead can define the initial tasks for a story or
requirement.
Set estimates: Assign effort estimates to each task to help gauge the total work
required.
Align with capacity: Use the capacity tool to ensure that the estimated work aligns
with your team’s available capacity.
By effectively adding and managing tasks, your team gains a clear understanding of the
relative importance and required effort for each item, ensuring better workload
distribution and project planning.

See also End of sprint activities.
If you exceed the number of items allowed on your Taskboard, you receive a message
indicating that you need to reduce the number of items. The maximum number of items
includes work item types included in the Requirement and Task categories.
You can reduce the number of items on the Taskboard by moving them to the backlog
or another sprint. When you move a parent PBI or user story, all active child tasks (State
not equal to Done or Closed) automatically move with the parent item.
From the Taskboard, drag the PBI or user story from the first column onto the

End-of-sprint activities
Article • 02/24/2023
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019 | TFS
2018
At the end of a sprint, teams may want to attend to several tasks to maintain backlog
hygiene. In general, incomplete work should never be assigned to a past sprint. Teams
need to determine how they want to handle work that isn't completed in a sprint and
take appropriate action.
At the end of each sprint, each team should determine and take action to address the
following questions:
How should we address user stories and their tasks that are only partially completed
at the end of the sprint?
What is the correct way to manage partially done work at the end so that sprint
metrics and velocity are correctly accounted for?
What should we review and in what order?
In general, end-of-sprint activities should be done before or after a sprint review
meeting and before a sprint retrospective. The main item to consider is to maintain
views and metrics to support the team in their sprint reviews, retrospectives, and sprint
planning.
Each sprint represents a time-boxed period of development to which work is assigned.
Review the following checklist for the goals to keep in mind when performing end-of-
sprint activities.
Maintain backlog hygiene where no incompleted work is assigned to a sprint
whose end date is in the past
Manage work item states and sprint assignments to support monitoring of team
progress and velocity
７ Note
There is no automatic way to move incomplete work items assigned to one sprint
to another. Nor, an automatic method for zeroing out Remaining Work.
Goals for end-of-sprint activities


# Page 841

Support team's continuous improvement activities
Support team's focus on shipping software and meeting sprint goals
Minimize work tracking efforts that have no value
The following suggestions walk through the main end-of-sprint activities teams should
consider performing. Typically, these activities should be done on the last day of the
sprint or after the sprint review meeting.
Review the sprint backlog for incomplete user stories, backlog items, and tasks.
You can perform the review by reviewing the sprint backlog or sprint taskboard.
Reassign user stories, backlog items, and tasks not started to the product
backlog or next sprint. Using the Planning pane, you can reassign to the team
backlog or a future sprint. Reassigned work items can be re-estimated and
prioritized.
Determine how to handle incomplete user stories, backlog items, or tasks. Keep
in mind the goal is to ship working software. The two choices here are:
Split the story into two to represent the work completed in the current sprint
and work yet to do. For more information, see Copy or clone stories, issues and
other work items.
Reassign the story to the next sprint where work can be completed. All
unfinished stories in the current sprint account for zero to the sprint's velocity.
Determine how to handle Remaining Work for completed tasks. If tasks are
complete, then having a non-zero value for Remaining Work doesn't make a lot of
sense. Teams should decide how they want to handle these cases and consider
setting the value of Remaining Work to zero for completed tasks.
 Tip
Team velocity is not a measure of team productivity and should only be used as a
metric for planning future sprints. Work is either complete at the end of a sprint or
it isn't. If it's done it counts. If it's not, then it gets reconsidered for a future sprint
and not the current sprint. Velocity tends to level itself out no matter what choices
you make. However, by considering only done work, you work toward a more
realistic value and a much better source of historical data to make future forecasts.
Decide team preferences
Review sprint backlog for incomplete work


# Page 842

To determine incomplete work, review the Sprint backlog for work that is still in a
committed, active, in progress state.
From the Sprint backlog, choose 
 View options and select Planning. Drag and drop
the work items that are incomplete to either the next sprint or back to the team backlog.
As shown in the following image, the Fabrikam Team backlog corresponds to the
default Iteration Path set for the team. Note that if the default is set to the
@CurrentIteration macro, then that selection wouldn't change the Iteration Path until
the start of the next sprint.
Reassign incomplete user stories and tasks to future
sprint


# Page 843

Over time, the number of sprints defined for a project or assigned to a team can grow.
To minimize the drop-down menu for Iteration paths, Project Administrators can choose
to move past sprints to an archive area. By maintaining the sprint assignment, but
moving it under a different sprint node, all work item data is retained. All sprint charts
and widgets continue to work.
As shown in the following image, sprints from 2012 and 2013 have been moved under
the Previous Sprints node.
Archive past sprints


# Page 844

The Sprint backlog automatically points to the current sprint as the active sprint based
on the start and end dates. If the current date falls within the sprint period, then the
corresponding sprint is the current sprint. No further action is required to make the next
sprint the active current sprint.
As a project or team administrator, make sure to meet the following guidance for
managing sprints.
Start and end dates defined for your project's sprints shouldn't overlap.
All sprints of interest to a team should be selected for that team's configuration.
 Tip
All data stored in work items is maintained by Azure DevOps until work items are
permanently deleted.

Customize cards on a sprint Taskboard
in Azure Boards
Article • 03/25/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Sprint Taskboards are similar to boards because they show work items as cards instead
of as lists. They're different in the ways summarized in Backlogs, Boards, and Plans.
Similar to boards, you can customize cards and add columns.
Taskboard: Have a sprint Taskboard you want to configure. When you add a team,
you add a Taskboard for every sprint that you select for your team. For more
information, see About teams and Agile tools.
Permissions: To add or rename columns, or customize cards, be added to the team
administrator role for the team's settings you want to modify, or be a member of
the Project Administrators security group.
To add or remove columns, choose Column Options. You customize all other options
through the Settings dialog for the Taskboard.

1. Meet with your team and determine how the team wants to manage bugs, similar
to requirements or tasks.
2. Add any tags to work items that you want to use to support styling rules.
If you want bugs to appear on your taskboard, change your team settings for show bugs
on the backlogs and boards.
Each team can customize their Taskboard columns and cards. Taskboard settings
are not inherited from other teams that they may share portions of area paths.
Understand the Taskboard customization
sequence
７ Note
You can customize a work item type which is different than customizing the card
displayed on the Taskboard. You customize a WIT by adding fields, changing the
workflow, adding custom rules and more. You can also add custom work item types
and custom backlog levels. For more information, see Customize an inheritance
process.
Show bugs on your taskboard
Add columns


# Page 849

You can add columns or rename columns that appear in your Taskboard. You'll see
different column titles and choices based on the process used to create your project and
whether your team has chosen to treat bugs like requirements or like tasks.
The changes made apply to all sprint Taskboards for the selected team.
1. From your web browser, open your team's sprint Taskboard as described in Update
and monitor your Taskboard. Remember, only team or project administrators can
customize the taskboard.
2. Choose Column Options.
3. In the Customize Columns dialog, choose the column you want to rename, or
choose Add Column.
In this example, we add a column named Review and set the Task to In Progress.
７ Note
Columns you add to a Taskboard aren't supported with corresponding fields such
as the board columns you add which is supported with Board Column field.


# Page 850

Similar to the board, each column must map to a category state. There are four
category states: Proposed, Committed, In Progress, and Completed. At least one
column must map to Proposed and one column must map to Completed. To learn
more about each state, see Workflow states and state categories.
4. To change the column order, hover over the column and choose the 
 grabber
icon and drag it up or down within the list of columns.
5. To delete a column, first make sure that the column doesn't contain any work
items. If it does, move the items to another column. Then, hover over the column
and choose the 
 delete icon.
Scrum teams use the Taskboard to burn down work and report on progress during daily
stand ups. Each sprint Taskboard shows cards that correspond to both requirements and

tasks.
Information rich cards not only provide at-a-glance information of interest to you and
your team. They also provide a way for you to update a field without opening the work
item. And, with style rules, you can highlight those work items with select colors based
on the criteria you set.
Each card corresponds to a work item that you use to share information, track status,
and assign work.
In this example, the bug work item type (WIT) shows all the core fields. It also shows
three other fields and tags. To make severity 1 bugs stand out, a styling rule has been
added to cause the card to display as yellow.
In the card shown below, the following customizations have been set for the task work
item type (WIT):
Show all core fields: ID, Assigned To, Remaining Work, Tags
Show three additional fields: Priority
Apply styling rule to display tasks with Priority=1 as green
Provide information-rich cards
７ Note
For more information, see Backlogs, boards, and plans. In case you don't see the
desired work items on your backlog or board, see Set up your backlogs and
boards.


# Page 852

You can either increase or simplify the information that displays on your cards. It all
depends on what's of interest to your team. Does your team like to refer to work items
by their ID? Do they want to see estimates? Do they want to highlight work items
according to set criteria? Or, do just the bare bones of title and assignment suffice?
Your best bet is to show fields on cards based on what your team frequently refers to.
Or, you can show fields based on updates when using the Taskboards. Also, add fields
with information that you can use to filter the board. If you're new to working with these
tools, see Sprint planning.
You change the way cards appear on the Taskboard in the same way you change the
appearance of cards on boards. Only here, you start from the Taskboard.
1. Open the taskboard for the sprint you want to customize. Remember, only team or
project administrators can customize the taskboard.
2. Choose the 
 gear icon to open the Settings dialog.
3. Choose Fields and then a work item type to see all the settings you can modify.
4. Place a check mark in the check box for those fields you want to have appear on
the board.
Add or remove fields from cards on the Taskboard


# Page 853

Repeat this step for each work item type you want to change. Don't be surprised if
the options change when you choose a different work item type. For example,
Show Remaining Work only applies to tasks and perhaps bugs, but not to user
stories or product backlog items.
5. To add a field, choose the 
 plus icon and enter the name of a field you want to
add.
6. To remove a field, choose the 
 delete icon next to the field.
7. When you're done with your changes, choose Save.
Using the board views provides you with quick and easy ways to update work items as
work progresses. Making daily or frequent updates helps everyone on your team stay in
sync with what's been done and what needs doing next.
To update status of a work item, you simply drag-and-drop cards to a different column.
To change the order or stack ranking of a work item, you drag a card up or down within

a column.
Moving the card from In Progress to the Done column on the Task board, for example,
updates the corresponding State field. In this case, the State field updates from Doing to
Done.
Another handy feature is to update a field without having to open the work item. You
can update most fields shown on the card. Here we reassign a task.
This quick update feature is useful when you need to update many work items at once.
For example, you can add estimates or update Remaining Work.
To change the title, choose the 
 actions icon, and then choose Edit title.


# Page 855

To add tags, double-click the work item to open it. And, just a reminder, you can't
change the IDs for a work item, not from the card and not from within the form.
With styling rules, you can cause cards to change color when their corresponding work
items meet criteria that you set. Here, we highlight Priority 1 tasks by having the cards
display as green.
What rules should you apply to highlight work items? Here are a few examples and their
associated criteria.

You can apply style rules to change the color of Taskboard cards based on specified field
criteria.
1. Open the Taskboard that you want to customize.
2. Choose the 
 gear icon to open the Settings dialog.
3. Choose Styles to specify a style rule. Choose the 
 plus icon to add a style. Select
the color to apply to the card and define the criteria for the style rule.
In this example, we show the Styles dialog for the taskboard.

Follow these rules when creating and ordering your style rules:
The criteria you specify works in a similar fashion as when constructing a
query.
All clauses are considered AND clauses, grouping clauses isn't supported.
Card rules apply to all work items that meet the rule criteria
Rule color applies to work items based on the order in which rules are listed.
If you add more than one style rule, make sure that you move them in the
order of most importance. Drag them into the order you want them applied.
You can quickly enable and disable a style rule.
Here we add a Stale tasks rule that highlights tasks that haven't changed in
the last five days.

Each column corresponds to a work item field. You can add and remove columns within
work item lists to show the fields of interest to you. Or, you can drag a column to a new
position. Your settings persist for each page you customize and are only valid for your
views.
Specifically, you can do the following actions from the following list views:

You can add most fields listed in the Work item field index. All fields defined within the
project collection or organization are available for selection, even those fields that aren't
used for your particular project. You can view the list of fields defined for your collection
from Organization Settings>Process>Fields
Once you set the column options for a specific view, your settings persist until you
change them. The following notes apply to specific views.
Column options you set for a backlog apply only to the active team and backlog.
Options you set for the product backlog differ from the options you set for a
portfolio backlog.
 Tip
Unlike a query result, you can't sort a backlog by a column. However, you can use
the Create Query link on each backlog to create a query that you can sort on any
field column you choose from the Sorting tab of the Column options dialog. While
you may be able to add a field to sort on, not all fields are supported. For example,
selection of the Parent, History, Description, or other rich-text field results in the
display of an error message as you can't sort on these fields.

Interactively filter backlogs, boards,
queries, and plans in Azure Boards
Article • 11/22/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Filter functions in Azure Boards empower you to interactively apply one or more filters
to streamline your work item management. Each Azure Boards tool—such as Backlogs,
Boards, and Query results—comes prefiltered to display a relevant subset of work items
based on its specific functionality:
Backlogs and boards: Show work items based on the selected Area Paths and
Iteration Paths for your team.
Query results: List work items that match the query clauses you defined.
To enhance your filtering capabilities, enable the filter feature by selecting the 
 Filter
icon.
Even with these initial filters, you might still encounter a large number of work items.
Interactive filtering allows you to narrow down your view and focus on a specific subset
of work items by applying more filter criteria to each Azure Boards tool.
Filters can significantly enhance your workflow by helping you accomplish the following
tasks:
Daily scrum meetings: Focus the board on work assigned for a specific sprint to
facilitate effective stand-ups.
Sprints Taskboard: Filter to view a particular team member's completed work,
aiding in performance reviews and accountability.
Group work items: Concentrate on related work items by filtering based on Parent
Work Item, Area Path, or Tags, enhancing organization and clarity.
Triage work items: Create and apply queries to isolate similar work items grouped
by Area Path or Tags, enabling efficient issue resolution and backlog grooming.
Use cases for filters


# Page 868

By using these filter functions, your team can maintain focus, improve productivity, and
ensure that critical tasks receive the attention they deserve.
For more detailed information on using filters, see Filter Backlogs, Boards, and Plans.
Project access: Be a project member.
Filter functions are available from all Azure Boards tools: Work items, Boards, Backlogs,
Sprint Backlogs and Taskboards, Queries, and Delivery Plans. The set of features
supported depends on the tool and Azure DevOps version. (Use the content selector to
view the filters available for your version.)
The following table indicates the supported options based on the tool indicated with a
✔️ or is listed.
Backlogs and boards are subject to filters defined for the team as described in Set up
your Backlogs and Boards. Other tools have predefined filters based on the view, query
filter clauses, or settings you select.

Notes
1. While the Parent Work Item isn't a filter function for Backlogs or Query Results,
you can add the Parent field as a column and then do a keyword/phrase search on
the Parent title to effectively filter on parent work items. The Parent field is
supported for Azure DevOps Server 2020 and later versions. See also the Parent
field and Parent Work Item section later in this article.
2. The Parent Work Item filter is supported for Sprint Backlogs and Taskboards for
Azure DevOps Server 2020 and later versions.
Along with the standard filter functions summarized in the previous table, the following

Notes
1. The Work items page is subject to filters based on the view selected. Boards and
Backlogs are subject to filters defined for the team as described in Set up your
Backlogs and Boards. Completed and In Progress work items get determined
based on the state categories assigned to the workflow state as described in How
workflow states and state categories are used in Backlogs and Boards.
2. Grouping is supported through portfolio backlogs and boards, parent-child links,
and tree hierarchy. Tree hierarchies are flattened when filtering is applied and
reinstated when filtering is cleared.
3. Backlogs and Sprint Backlogs support reordering. However, when filtering is
enabled, reordering isn't supported.
4. Taskboards provides a Group by function based on People or Stories.
5. Query Results supports multi-column sort.
6. Work items appear in the order defined for the team Sprint backlog, which it
inherits from the team product backlog.
7. Semantic search supports sorting search results by the following fields—Assigned
To, Changed Date, Created Date, ID, State, Tags, Title, and Work Item Type—and
Relevance.
For more information about these other functions, see the following articles:

# Page 874

The Parent Work Item filter enables you to focus on one or more select features or
epics. This filter function was added in July 2016 and made available in Azure DevOps
Server 2017 and later versions.
The Parent field was added to Azure Boards in July of 2019 and then made available
with the release of Azure DevOps Server 2020. You can add the Parent field to a list
through the Column Options dialog, except for the Work items tool. You can also add
the Parent field to cards on the boards and Taskboards.
Once you set filter options for a specific view, your settings persist until you modify
them. There's no need to select a save button or take any other actions.
To filter work items based on specific fields, first add the field as a column or to the card.
For example, to filter by Assigned To, Iteration Path, Work Item Type, or any other
field's content, ensure these fields are displayed on the cards, backlog, plan, or list.
All filter configurations are user-specific and remain active until you clear them.
To add columns or fields, see the following articles:
For Backlogs and Queries, see Change column options
For Boards, see Customize cards
For Taskboards, see Customize a sprint Taskboard
For Plans, see Review team delivery plans.
1. From the Azure Boards tool, choose the view you want. For example:
For Work items, select Assigned to me, Following, Mentioned, or other view.
For Backlogs and Boards, select the backlog level you want, such as Stories,
Features, or Epics.
For sprint Backlogs and Taskboards, choose the iteration
For queries, define the query filter criteria of interest.

2. Choose any other view settings available for your view. For example:
For Work items, from the View options menu, enable/disable Completed
Work Items.
For Backlogs, from the View options menu, enable/disable In Progress items
or Completed Child items.
For Taskboards, from the Person menu, choose All, Unassigned, or a specific
team member.
3. For list views, add columns to display fields containing text you want to filter on or
possibly sort on. For card views, add fields to display on cards containing text you
want to filter on.
4. Select Filter 
 . Or, enter the Ctrl+Shift+f keyboard shortcut.
For example, here we open the filter toolbar for the board, Backlog items.
::: moniker-end
5. Choose your filters of interest.
The filter icon changes to a solid icon, Filter 
 , to indicate filtering is applied.
The page refreshes to show only those work items that meet all the selected filter
criteria.
When filtering is applied, the following functions are disabled or altered:
For backlogs, the add-a-backlog-item panel, reordering (stack ranking), and
forecasting tools are disabled.
For backlogs set to Show Parents, the tree hierarchy is flattened, unless you enable
the Keep hierarchy with filters from the View Options menu. See [Filter your
backlog and maintain the hierarchy](#keep hierarchy) provided later in this article.
To clear and dismiss filtering, choose Clear and dismiss filtering 
 .
Inactive functions
Clear or dismiss filtering


# Page 876

Filters remain in place until you explicitly clear them. When you refresh your backlog,
board, or other tool, or sign in from another browser, filters remain set to your previous
values.
Once the board is filtered, you can choose the filter icon to hide the drop downs and
view the applied filters on the board. The filter icon turns opaque to signify a filtered
board.
You can filter your backlog and maintain the hierarchy of work by choosing show
Parents and Keep hierarchy with filters from the View Options menu. Use these options
when you want to show work items assigned to one or more team members, work item
types, area or iteration paths, or combination of these items and keywords. The
hierarchy is maintained and work items that match the filter criteria are shown in bold
text.
Filter your backlog and maintain the hierarchy


# Page 877

Applying Boolean operators to filters is only supported for tags, as described in Filter
based on tags later in this article. All other filters are applied with an implicit AND
operator.
The keyword filter allows you to search lists or cards based on the fields configured
through Column Options or board settings. You can filter by specific values, such as IDs
even if the ID field is visible. When using the keyword filter, ensure that the fields
containing the desired text or tags are displayed in your view.
The filter criteria ignore the following characters: ,  (comma), .  (period), /  (forward
slash), and \  (back slash).
Here we filter the board to only show those cards that include 'web' either in the title,
tag, or field.

# Page 878

Here we filter the Backlog with Show Parents enabled, to only show work items that
include 'web'.
The filtered set is always a flat list, even if you selected to show parents.
With filtering turned on, choose one or more values from the multi-select drop-down
menu for each field available to you. The values for these fields are populated as follows:
Area: The Node Name, which specifies the last node of an Area Path, of valid Area
Paths and for which there are work items assigned to that Area Path
Assigned To: All users who are currently assigned to work items on the board plus
Unassigned
Iteration: All Iteration Paths selected for the current team and for which there are
work items assigned to that iteration
Work item type: Work item types defined for the Requirements Category (product
backlog) or Features or Epic categories (feature or epic portfolio backlogs), subject
to work items being assigned to the work item types
Tags: All tags assigned to work items on the board
Parent Work Items: All features defined for the team, or all epics defined for the
team when viewing the Features board
Filter a backlog by using a keyword
Filter based on a field
７ Note


# Page 879

You can filter by select field values using the board for your product backlog (Stories,
Product Backlog Items, or Requirements) or a portfolio backlog (Features or Epics).
For example, here we filter for all items assigned to Jamal and Raisa.
Cards are filtered based on the assignments made in the following order and logic:
1. Assigned to: Show all cards that are assigned to user 1 OR  user 2 AND
2. Iteration: Show all cards that are assigned to Iteration 1 OR  Iteration 2 AND
3. Work Item type: Show all cards that are work item type 1 OR  work item type 2 AND
4. Tags: Show all cards that have tag 1 AND  or OR  tags 2, based on your selection of
AND | OR . AND
5. Parent Work Items: Show all cards that have Parent Work Item 1 OR  Parent Work
Item 2.
Filter options are dependent on the work items that meet the filter criteria. For
example, if you don't have any work items assigned to Sprint 4, then the Sprint 4
option won't appear in the filter options for the Iteration Path.
The values that populate the filter options are based on the work items that are
currently loaded and displayed. For example, if you have a backlog with 2,000 work
items, but only 1,000 are displayed on a board, the filter options are based on just
the items displayed.
Filter a board by using select field values
Board filter logic


# Page 880

Here we show a filtered backlog based on the keyword "issues." Filtered pages show the
 filtered icon. The filtered set is always a flat list, even if you selected to show a
hierarchical backlog view.
You can use the Filter by parent feature to filter by select parent work items using the
board for your product backlog (Stories, Product Backlog Items, or Requirements) or a
portfolio backlog (Features).
Use this feature only when you created features or epics and linked them to user stories
or features, respectively. A quick and easy way to create the links is to map them using
drag-and-drop. Mapping creates parent-child links between the work items.
To start filtering, choose Filter 
 . Choose one or more values from the multi-select
drop-down menu for the Parent Work Item. These values are derived from the Features
you defined.
Here, we choose two features on which to filter the board:
Filter a backlog by using fields
Filter based on the Parent Work Item
７ Note
The Filter by parent feature doesn't support filtering of parent work items of the
same work item type. For example, you can't filter the Stories backlog by specifying
user stories that are parents of nested user stories.


# Page 881

The final board displays just those stories linked as child work items to the selected
features.
If you added tags to your work items, you can filter your work using one or more tags.
For backlogs and query results, add Tags as a column option before filtering on tags.
Check the boxes of those tags that you want to filter on. Keep the OR selection to do a
logical OR for all the tags you selected. Or, choose the AND option to do a logical AND
on all the selected tags.
Filter based on tags


# Page 882

For more information about tags, see Add tags to work items to categorize and filter
lists and boards.
In addition to all the filter features described earlier in this article, you can also filter the
history view within a work item form.
To quickly find revisions made that contain a keyword, or made by specific people or to
a specific field, enable the filter feature by choosing 
 Toggle filter.

3. Determine and set sprint capacity in
Azure Boards
Article • 11/27/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
While velocity correlates to how your team estimates requirements, capacity correlates
to actual task time. Time is calculated in either hours or days. Capacity takes into
consideration the variation in work hours by team members. It also considers holidays,
vacation days, and nonworking days.
Because days off and time available for each team member might vary from sprint to
sprint, set capacity for each sprint. The capacity tool helps you make sure your team isn't
overcommitted or undercommitted for the sprint. As you work day-to-day, you see if
your team is on track.
In this article, learn how to do the following tasks.
To set up sprints yet for your team, see Manage sprint timelines.

About the Activity or Discipline pick-list items


# Page 885

To change the Activity or Discipline menu selections, see Add and manage fields.
Most teams specify capacity in hours. You can also specify it in days or any other units
your team chooses. For example, 0.5 days would correspond to 4 hours for a typical 8
hour day. Choose the same unit your team uses to estimate and track their time. For
example, the entries they make to the Original Estimate or Remaining Work fields. For
more information, see Fields used to estimate and track work.
1. From your web browser, open your product backlog. Check that you selected the
right project. Select Boards > Sprints, select the correct team from the team
selector menu, and choose Capacity.
To choose another team, open the selector and select a different team or choose
the Browse all sprints option. You can enter a keyword in the search box to filter
the list of team backlogs for the project.

2. To choose a different sprint than the one shown, open the sprint selector and
choose the sprint you want.
The system lists only those sprints that are selected for the current team focus. If
you don't see the sprints you want listed, then choose New Sprint from the menu,
and then choose Select existing iteration. For more information, see Define
iteration (sprint) paths.
From the Capacity page, you can add team members, enter the team time off, and set
capacity and days off for each team member.

1. If you don't see your team members listed, add them. Choose the 
 action icon
and select Add all team members. For this feature to work, users must be added
to the team.
The Add all team members action retrieves a maximum of 100 team members. If
you have more team members to add, you can add them one-by-one by choosing
Add user.
2. If you need to add other contributors to your project, choose the 
 Add user.
3. Set team member time off. For the entire team days off, choose the 0 days link as
shown.
In the Days off for dialog, select the start and end days during the sprint for the
team member or team days off.
 Tip


# Page 888

4. Set the Activity/Discipline and Capacity per day for each team member. If you
track capacity simply by team member, you can leave the Activity or Discipline
selection unassigned.
For example, Christie Church's capacity is 6 hours/day for design work.
By copying the capacity from the previous sprint, you save time. With the basics defined,
all you have to do is adjust the capacity based on individual and team days off and
capacity allocation per activity.
Only the capacity-per-day value and activity value are copied over. Individual and team
days off remain unset. The copy operation always copies the latest updates made to the
previous sprint. So you can repeat the copy operation if you made changes to the
previous sprint that you want to copy to the latest sprint.
Your sprint planning and tracking tools automatically consider days off when
calculating capacity and sprint burndown. You only have to indicate planned
days off for the team. For more information, see Set capacity for the team
and team members.
Copy capacity planning from the previous
sprint


# Page 889

To remove a user, choose the option from the users 
 action menu. This action doesn't
remove the user from the team.
As you define tasks and estimate the work, capacity charts start to fill in for each team
member. Capacity bars track the remaining work against the capacity for each team
member and the entire team.
You also see a roll-up of the remaining work required to complete each requirement or
bug.
Remove a user from capacity
Review capacity charts


# Page 890

From this view, you can see which individuals are at or near capacity. Teams can
determine if work needs to be moved out of the sprint or to reassign tasks.
 Tip
Define tasks that take a day or less to complete. This helps mitigate the risks that
come from poor estimates.
Also, don't divide tasks into subtasks. If you do divide a task into subtasks, specify
Remaining Work only for the subtasks, as the system rolls up summary values to
the parent task.
Track capacity when completing multiple
activities


# Page 891

Because individual team members have different sets of skills and duties, you can track
their activity and capacity for each activity and for each sprint.
Here, Jamal divides time between Deployment and Development.
If you work on more than one team, specify your sprint capacity for each team. For
example, both Christie and Raisa split their time between the Web and Phone teams. As
such, give 3 hours a day to the Web team, and 3 hours a day to the Phone team.

Much of sprint planning involves a negotiation between the product owner and the
team to determine the focus and work to tackle in the upcoming sprint. It's useful to
time-box the planning meeting, restricting it to 4 hours or less.
In the first part of the meeting, your product owner meets with your team to discuss the
user stories that might be included in the sprint. Your product owner shares information
and answers any questions that your team has about those stories. This conversation
might reveal details such as data sources and user interface layout. Or it might reveal
response time expectations, and considerations for security and usability. Your team
should capture these details within the backlog items form. During this part of the
meeting, your team learns what it must build.
As you plan your sprints, you may discover other requirements to capture and add to
your backlog. Make sure it's well defined and in priority order.
Also, setting a sprint goal as part of your planning efforts can help the team stay
focused on what's most important for each sprint.
After you've planned your sprint, you may want to share the plan with key stakeholders.
You can learn more from these resources:
What is Scrum?
Sprint planning white paper
The Scrum Guide
Build and manage the product backlog white paper
Scrum teams use sprint goals to focus their sprint activities. They often set this goal
during their sprint planning meeting. The goal summarizes what the team wants to
accomplish by the end of the sprint. By explicitly stating the goal, you create shared
Sprint planning meetings

understanding within the team of the core purpose. The sprint goal can also help guide
the team when conflicts arise around priorities.
The sprint goal defines what the product owner and the team consider as the ultimate
target to accomplish that sprint. It's not a random selection of backlog items that don't
really have a relationship, but a short piece of text that captures what the team should
try to accomplish. Normally the product owner comes up with the sprint goal before
selecting many items for the next sprint. The items for that sprint should all fit that
common goal.
Sprint goals can be feature oriented, but might also have a large process component
such as deployment automation or test automation.
For example:
This sprint we'll focus on a simple user story. We'll use it to prove that the
proposed solution works.
This sprint revolves around implementing the security features that properly secure
the administration section of the website.
This sprint is about integrating the most important payment gateways so that we
can start collecting money.
Setting the sprint goals helps the team to stay focused. It makes it easier to define
priority of tasks within a sprint and it probably helps limit the number of stakeholders
and end users that are involved.
During the sprint review, the most important question you should ask yourself is
whether you managed to achieve the sprint goal. How many stories you completed
comes second. If the goal is accomplished, the sprint succeeds, even if not all stories
were finished.

Fixing bugs represents a trade-off with other work. Use your triage meeting to
determine how important fixing each bug is against other priorities related to meeting
the project scope, budget, and schedule.
Tips from the trenches: Define sprint goals
Tips for successful triage meetings


# Page 895

Establish the team's criteria for evaluating which bugs to fix and how to assign
priority and severity. Bugs associated with features of significant value (or
significant opportunity cost of delay), or other project risks, should be assigned
higher priority and severity. Store your triage criteria with other team documents
and update as needed.
Use your triage criteria to determine which bugs to fix and how to set their State,
Priority, Severity, and other fields.
Adjust your triage criteria based on where you are in your development cycle. Early
on, you may decide to fix most of the bugs that you triage. However, later in the
cycle, you may raise the triage criteria to reduce the number of bugs that you need
to fix.
Once you've triaged a bug, assign it to a developer. The developer can then
investigate and determine how to implement a fix.
Consider managing your bug bar and technical debt as part of your team's overall set of
continuous improvement activities. You may find these resources of interest:
Good and Bad Technical Debt (and how TDD helps)
 by Henrik Kniberg
Managing Technical Debt
 posted by Sven Johann & Eberhard Wolff
Agile Bug Management: Not an Oxymoron
by Gregg Boer, Principal Program Manager, Visual Studio Cloud Services at Microsoft
Every sprint, the team looks at any bugs remaining in the bug backlog and dedicates
capacity to get that known set of bugs down to zero, or near-zero. Whether this is one
day, one week, or the entire sprint, they fix the bugs first. Bugs found later, within the
sprint, aren't considered part of that initial commitment. Unless they're high priority,
they're put on the bug backlog for the next sprint.
Many teams work in a commitment-based organization. Often, management places a
high value on a team's ability to meet their commitments. Doing capacity planning
against a known set of bugs makes sprint planning more deterministic, increasing their
chance to meet commitments. Any new bugs discovered during the sprint aren't a part
of the initial commitment, and can be addressed next sprint.
Manage your technical debt
Tips from the trenches: Bug management
Address any known bug debt every sprint


# Page 896

An organization transitioning to a culture where debt is continually eliminated likely is
dealing with the following question: How do you get teams to reduce their bug count
without telling them exactly what to do? Leadership wants the team to change, yet gives
the team autonomy to determine how they change. One option is to use a bug cap.
For example, consider a bug cap of three bugs per engineer. As such, a team of 10
people shouldn't have more than 30 bugs in its bug backlog. If the team is over its cap,
it's expected to stop work on new features and get under the bug cap. A team is
expected to be under its cap always, but the team decides how it wants to do that. The
bug cap ensures that teams don't carry bug debt for too long. The team can learn from
the mistakes that causes the bugs to be injected in the first place.
Remember that the bug cap represents the bugs in the bug backlog. It doesn't include
bugs found and fixed within the sprint in which a feature is developed. Those bugs are
considered undone work, not debt.
While bugs contribute to technical debt, they may not represent all debt.
Poor software design, poorly written code, or short-term fixes can all contribute to
technical debt. Technical debt reflects extra development work that arises from all these
problems.
Track work to address technical debt as PBIs, user stories, or bugs. To track a team's
progress in incurring and addressing technical debt, you'll want to consider how to
categorize the work item and the details you want to track. You can add tags to any
work item to group it into a category of your choosing.
Scrum Masters help build and maintain healthy teams by employing Scrum processes.
They guide, coach, teach, and assist Scrum teams in the proper employment of Scrum
methods. Scrum Masters also act as change agents to help teams overcome
impediments and to drive the team toward significant productivity increases.
Core responsibilities of Scrum Masters include:
Support the team to adopt and follow Scrum processes. For example, you
shouldn't let the daily Scrum meeting become an open discussion that lasts 45
minutes.
Manage bug debt across an enterprise
Role of the Scrum Master


# Page 897

Guard against the product owner or team members from adding work after the
sprint begins.
Clear blocking issues that prevent the team from making forward progress. This
work might require you to complete small tasks, such as approving a purchase
order for a new build computer or resolving a conflict within your team.
Help the team work to resolve conflicts and issues that arise and learn from the
process.
Ask questions that reveal hidden issues and confirm that what people are
communicating is well understood by the entire team.
Identify and safeguard the team from potential issues becoming major issues. Just
as it's cheaper to fix a bug soon after it's discovered, it's also easier and less
disruptive to fix a team issue when it's small and manageable.
Prevent the team from presenting incomplete user stories during a sprint review
meeting.
Gather, analyze, and present data to business stakeholders to demonstrate how
the team is improving and growing. For example, if your team has increased the
amount of value that it has delivered while generating fewer bugs, make the value
visible through regular communications to business stakeholders.
Good Scrum Masters have or develop excellent communication, negotiation, and
conflict resolution skills. They actively listen to the words that people say and write. They
also listen to how they deliver their messages, for example their body language, facial
expressions, vocal pace, and other nonverbal communication.
Just as it's cheaper to fix a bug soon after it's discovered, it's also easier and less
disruptive to fix a team issue when it's small and manageable before it grows into a
major issue.
Daily Scrum meetings help keep a team focused on what it needs to do the next day.
Staying focused helps the team maximize their ability to meet sprint commitments. Your
Scrum Master should enforce the structure of the meeting and ensure that it starts on
time and finishes in 15 minutes or less.
Three aspects of successful Scrum meetings are:
Everyone stands up. Standing up helps to keep the meetings focused and short.
Daily Scrum meetings


# Page 898

They start and end on time and occur at the same time in the same location each
day
Everyone participates, each team member answers the three Scrum questions:
What have I accomplished since the most recent Scrum?
What can I accomplish before the next Scrum?
What blocking issues or impediments might affect my work?
Team members should strive to answer their questions quickly and concisely. For
example:
"Yesterday, I updated the class to reflect the new data element that we pull from the
database, and I got it to appear in the interface. This task is complete. Today, I ensure
that the new data element is correctly calculating with the stored procedure and the
other data elements in the table. I believe I can accomplish this task today. I need
someone to review my calculations. I have no impediments or blocking issues."
This response conveys what the team member accomplished, what the team member
plans to accomplish, and that the team member would like some help looking at the
code.
Contrast with this next example:
"Yesterday, I worked on the class, and it works. Today, I work on the interface. No
blocking issues."
The team member doesn't provide enough detail about what class they worked on nor
about the interface components they'll complete. In fact, the word accomplished never
came up.
It's important that no one interrupts during report outs. Each person must have
sufficient time to answer the three questions.
More in-depth and follow-up discussions should take place after the meeting, as people
return to their desks or, if a significant amount of conversation is necessary, in a follow-
up meeting.
７ Note
The focus for scrum meetings is on the status of work that needs to be passed from
one team member to another team member.


# Page 899

Many teams delay discussions by using the "virtual parking lot" method. As subjects
come up that a team member thinks needs further discussion, they can quietly walk to a
whiteboard or flipchart and list the subject in the parking lot. At the end of the meeting,
the team determines how they'll handle the listed items.
Conduct your sprint review meetings on the last day of the sprint. Your team
demonstrates each product backlog item that it completed in the sprint. The product
owner, customers, and stakeholders accept the user stories that meet their expectations
and identify any new requirements. Customers often understand their needs more fully
after seeing the demonstrations and may identify changes that they want to see.
Based on this meeting, some user stories get accepted as complete. Incomplete user
stories remain in the product backlog. New user stories get added to the backlog. Both
sets of stories get ranked and either estimated or re-estimated in the next sprint
planning meeting.
After this meeting and the retrospective meeting, your team plans the next sprint.
Because business needs change quickly, you can take advantage of this meeting with
your product owner, customers, and stakeholders to review the priorities of the product
backlog again.
Retrospectives, when conducted well and at regular intervals, support continuous
improvement.
The sprint retrospective meeting typically occurs on the last day of the sprint, after the
sprint review meeting. In this meeting, your team explores its execution of Scrum and
what might need tweaking.
Based on discussions, your team might change one or more processes to improve its
own effectiveness, productivity, quality, and satisfaction. This meeting and the resulting
improvements are critical to the agile principle of self-organization.
Sprint review meetings

 extension. This extension supports collecting feedback on your


# Page 900

Look to address these areas during your team sprint retrospectives:
Issues that affected your team's general effectiveness, productivity, and quality.
Elements that affected your team's overall satisfaction and project flow.
What happened to cause incomplete backlog items? What actions can the team
take to prevent these issues in the future?
For example, consider a team that had several tasks that only one individual on the
team could do. The isolated expertise created a critical path that threatened the
sprint's success. The individual team member put in extra hours while other team
members were frustrated they couldn't do more to help. Going forward, the team
decided to practice eXtreme Programming
 to help correct this problem over
time.
As a team, work to determine whether to adapt one or more processes to minimize the
occurrence of problems during the sprint.
Your team may need to do some work to implement an improvement. For example, a
team that found themselves negatively affected by too many failed builds decided to
implement continuous integration. Because they didn't want to disrupt process, they
took a few hours to set up a trial build before turning it on in their production build. To
represent this work, they created a spike and organized that work against the rest of the
product backlog.

Burndown and burnup charts support project management to visually track work
completed over time. Burndown charts begin with the total amount of planned work. As
work is completed, the burndown graphs the remaining work. With the progression of
time, the amount of to-do work decreases. Burnup charts track work as it is completed
over time. They are useful to show the rate at which work is getting completed.

Capacity correlates to actual task time, either hours or days, that an individual or a team
has to work. Azure DevOps provides a Capacity tool for each team's sprint to set
capacity. Teams typically set capacity when they plan to create tasks and estimate the
time it takes to complete a task.
By setting team capacity, the team knows exactly the total number of work hours or
days the team has for each sprint. With this tool, you set individual team member
capacity and days off. Setting capacity for each team member working during a sprint
causes the capacity bar for that individual to appear. Learn more: Set sprint capacity.
With capacity bars, you can quickly see who is over, at, or under capacity. Capacity bars
update with each of these activities:
Tasks are assigned with non-zero remaining work
Change in remaining work
Date change within the sprint cycle. Individual and team capacity always reflects
their capacity from the current day until the end of the sprint.

needs more fully after seeing the demonstrations and may identify changes that they
want to see. Learn more: Scrum best practices, Sprint retrospective meeting.
A task is a type of work item used to track estimated and remaining work. In Scrum, a
task is defined to range between four and twelve hours. Defining tasks are essential for

Velocity provides a useful metric for gaining insight into how much work your team can
complete during a sprint cycle. After your team has worked several sprints, they can use
the velocity chart and forecast tool to estimate work that can be accomplished in future
sprints.
Velocity is a measure of how much work a team can complete based on their sprint
cadence. The built-in velocity chart measures velocity by summing the Story Points
(Agile), Effort (Scrum), or Size (CMMI) defined for a sprint.
For example, in the chart shown below the green bar indicates the total estimated effort
(story points) of the user stories completed within each sprint. Blue corresponds to the
estimated effort of items not yet completed. Learn more: View and work with the built-
in team velocity chart.

effort. Learn more: Configure the Velocity widget.
Each team is associated with one and only one velocity chart. Velocity varies depending
on team capacity, sprint over sprint. However, over time, the velocity should indicate a
reliable average that can be used to forecast the full backlog. By minimizing the
variability of backlog item size—effort or story points—you gain more reliable velocity
metrics. Learn more: Add tasks to backlog items.

Configure and monitor sprint burndown
Article • 12/18/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Throughout your sprint, you can monitor the sprint burndown report to determine if
your team is on track to complete its sprint plan. There are two sprint accessible
burndown charts: the in-context Burndown Trend report viewable from a team sprint
backlog and the Sprint Burndown widget that you can add to a dashboard.
Both the report and the widget derive data from Analytics. They support monitoring
burndown based on a count of work items or a sum of Story Points/Size/Effort,
Remaining Work, or other numeric field.
You can add either the report or widget to a dashboard. Also, you can monitor progress
using the Analytics-based burndown or burnup widgets. They provide more
configuration options.
Use this article to learn about:
） Important
Deleting Area Paths or reconfiguring Iteration Paths causes irreversible data
loss. For example, burndown and burnup widget charts, sprint burndown, and
velocity charts for teams with changed Area Paths won't display accurate
data. Historical trend charts reference the Area Path and Iteration Path as
they were defined at the time for each work item. Once deleted, you can't
retrieve historical data for these paths.
You can only delete area and iteration paths that are no longer used by any
work items.

For an overview of all burndown and burnup charts available to you, see Burndown and
burnup guidance.
The Burndown Trend report is based on either a count of tasks or remaining work
estimates, or other numeric fields that you define and update throughout the sprint
cycle. For details, see Sprint planning. To open this report, see Open a Sprint backlog.
A healthy sprint burndown report looks something like the image shown here. The blue
area indicates the number of work items active or in progress each day of the sprint. As
shown in this example, one work item is still active at the end of the sprint.
７ Note
Sprint burndown reports are derived from data tracked by a team during a sprint or
iteration. For more information, see About teams and Agile tools.

Description
Date range
The start and end date of the sprint.
Stories
Remaining
The number of stories remaining in the sprint. If you choose a different work item
type, the remaining number of those work items is shown.
Completed
The percentage of work completed based on original scope. Select Completed to
see the full list of completed work items.
Average
burndown
Average work completed.
Total Scope
Increase
Shows the change in how much work from the original scope since the burndown
started. The example shows that six work items were removed.
Remaining
The number of work items active or in progress. The example shows one active
item is remaining in the sprint.
Total Scope
The total number of work items in the sprint including closed work items. If the
team's default iteration is the @CurrentIteration, then new work items are added
to the current iteration. The scope decreases as the Iteration Path is modified to
another sprint, or work items are completed.
Ideal Trend
The ideal burndown rate for the sprint calculated from the number of work items,
days in the sprint, and number of working days.
Because individual team members might only update their work items once a week or
every few days, there's usually a stair-case burndown pattern.
In the widget catalog, you find two versions of the Sprint Burndown widget: the
Analytics-based Sprint Burndown and Sprint Burndown (Legacy), which is built from
the work tracking data store.
The Analytics-based Sprint Burndown widget provides an easy way to monitor progress
for a team by showing work remaining for a given sprint. Work remaining is the vertical
axis and time is the horizontal axis. You can define remaining work based on Stories or
Tasks, and by counting the work items or summing a field.

Prerequisites


# Page 916

Feature enablement: Have Boards enabled. If disabled, none of the work tracking
Analytics widgets display. To re-enable it, see Turn a service on or off.
Task awareness: Be aware of the required and recommended tasks, listed later in
this article.
To monitor sprint burndown, your team must schedule sprints and assign work to those
sprints.
If you want to monitor sprint burndown based on tasks and Remaining Work, your team
must carry out these extra actions.
Define and estimate tasks for each product backlog item that you're working on in
the sprint. If you work from your team's backlog and taskboard, the items you
create are automatically assigned to the current sprint (Iteration) and to your
team's default Area Path. For more information, see Add tasks to backlog items to
support sprint planning.
Update Remaining Work for each sprint task as work progresses. For more
information, see Update tasks during the sprint cycle.
To decrease the effect of poor estimates, define tasks that take a day or less to
complete.
Don't divide tasks into subtasks. If you divide a task into subtasks, specify hours
only for the subtasks. These hours are rolled up as summary values for the parent
task.
To support monitoring and achieve a smoother burndown chart, update Remaining
Work daily or several times within a week.
At the end of the sprint, update the task status of completed tasks and determine
how to handle incomplete tasks.
If your sprint burndown chart appears empty, check these points:
Team activities to track tasks and Remaining
Work
Required activities
Recommended activities

Did you assign tasks to the sprint associated with the chart?
Did you assign Remaining Work to the tasks assigned to the sprint?
Are the parent work items of the tasks assigned to the same sprint? If not, the
tasks might appear in another sprint associated with the parent item.

Configure a burndown or burnup
widget
Article • 09/25/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
The burndown and burnup widgets give you flexibility to create charts for any type of
scope or number of teams in specified time periods. Burndown charts focus on
remaining work. Burnup charts focus on completed work. Both chart types help your
team determine whether you're on track to complete your work by the end date. For an
overview of all burndown and burnup charts available to you, see Burndown and burnup
guidance.
This diagram shows a Burndown widget configured to display a release burndown.
Access:
Be a member of a project with at least Basic access.
To add a widget to a team dashboard, be a member of the team.
Prerequisites


# Page 929

Permissions: Be a team administrator or project administrator, or have specific
dashboard permissions granted to you.
Feature enablement: Have Boards enabled. If disabled, none of the work tracking
Analytics widgets display. To re-enable it, see Turn a service on or off.
Task awareness: Be aware of the required and recommended tasks, listed later in
this article.
Use the following procedure to add a burndown or burnup widget to your dashboard.
1. Sign in to your organization ( https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization} ).
2. Go to your project. Select Dashboards, and then 
 Edit.
3. Select a widget, and then Add.
Add the widget to your dashboard



# Page 930

Do the following steps to configure both widget types. The only difference between the
burndown and burnup widgets is that the burnup widget plots work completed and the
burndown widget plots work remaining. For more information, see how to interpret a
burndown or burnup chart, later in this article.
1. On the widget, select 
 Configure.
2. Complete configuration information, described in the following table, and then
select Save.

Guidance
Teams
To track progress across teams, add more teams. You can select teams from
other projects, but the lists of selectable backlogs, work item types, and fields
are based on your current project. Tracking across multiple projects only works
if the process for those projects is the same, or at least similar.
Work items
Backlog includes all the work item types configured for that backlog. If your
project is customized using a Hosted XML process and has a customized bug
work item category name, the burndown and burnup widgets can't query for
work items in that category. To query for bugs, the customized bug work item
type must belong to the default Bug category, reference name
Microsoft.BugCategory .
Field criteria
Select field criteria to limit the work items that appear in the chart. Filtering is
based on values assigned to fields as defined for each work item on the date
within the tracking period. For more information, see Filters that apply to
historical data.
Analytics-based charts are built based on the WorkItemsSnapshot  entity set.
Snapshot entity types are modeled as daily snapshots. Data aggregates based
on assignments made as of the date they're assigned. So, if you want to filter a
burndown or burnup widget based on field or tag assignments, assign them
previous to the period you want to monitor. Otherwise, the widget doesn't
recognize them until the date on which they're applied. You can filter on a null
value for the Field criteria, which is consistent with a query using the same field
criteria.
Burndown on
Choose how you want to calculate burndown by Count of work items or by
Sum based on a selected field. You can select from standard or custom fields of
integer or decimal data type, such as Story Points, Effort, or Remaining Work.
Burndown works best when you aggregate size fields like Story Points. If you
choose to burndown on fields that change during the sprint, like Remaining
Work for Tasks, the calculation of Items not Estimated grows as items get
closed.
Time period
- Start Date: Determines the original scope baseline. The chart burns down
from the original scope.
- % Complete and Total Scope Increase: Calculated based on your original
scope.
- End Date: Specifies the target date of completion. Your goal is to burndown
the original scope of work by the End Date.
Plot interval
Select the intervals to plot between the Start Date and End Date. Average
burndown is based on the selected interval. After you select the start date, set
Plot burndown by to Iteration. The Average Burndown assumes that every
interval is the same length and that the interval between the start date and the
first month is a full month. Even if the length of time between start date and
ﾉ
Expand table


# Page 932

Configuration
category
Guidance
the first month's end date doesn't match your typical length of a month, the
length is the same. For best results, enter a Start Date that is the same as the
first month's start date, which is also true when plotting by weekly intervals.
Advanced
features
- Show burndown: Displays both the historical and projected future burndown.
- Show total scope: Displays both the historical and projected scope increase.
- Show completed work: It displays remaining work and completed work as
stack bar.
- Plot remaining using work item type color: Displays remaining work based
on the work item type color, rather than the default blue color. If multiple work
items are included, then it stacks colors by work item type.
Your team can get immediate insight as to their progress and learn about their rhythm
and behavior. Most burndown lines aren't straight lines. The team never moves at
exactly one fixed velocity. Scope increases occur over time. For example, if your
projected completion date moves, you might want to ask one of these questions:
Are we adding too much scope?
Is the average burn rate changing, and if so, why?
Burndown charts also help teams understand risks to their release. If the projected end
date exceeds the release target date, teams might need to reduce scope or lengthen the
project. Burndown can also indicate that progress is greater than expected, providing
the uncommon, but wonderful option of adding scope.
As the following diagram shows, charts based on the burndown or burnup widgets
provide many calculated elements.

Description
Date range
The start and end date of the burndown. When burndown gets plotted
by iterations, the end date is the end of the last iteration.
Main metric

Shows only when burning down on the Sum of a field. It represents the
current number of items that don't have a value in the selected
Burndown on field. Select the number to see a full list of work items
without estimates.
Total Scope Increase
Shows how much work was added to the original scope since the
burndown started.
Projected completion
Calculates the projected completion date based on the remaining work
and historical burndown and scope increase rates. If the projected
completion date is before the specified End Date, it draws a vertical line
on the interval when the work should complete. If the projected
completion date is after the specified End Date, it displays the number of
other intervals or iterations needed to complete the work.

Description
Original Scope
Original scope is all remaining work since the specified Start Date. The
chart burns down from the original scope. % Complete and Total Scope
Increase are calculated based on your original scope.
Total Scope
Represents to the total scope of the burndown. The plotted points
include both completed and remaining work. The total scope line
indicates the scope change of your project. For past data points, the
plotted total scope represents actual total scope as of the end of each
interval or iteration. For future data points, the plotted total scope
represents a projected scope change, based on past scope changes.
Burndown
Represents the burndown. The burndown line tells you how fast you're
burning down the work. For past data points, the plotted burndown
represents actual burndown as of the end of each interval or iteration.
For future data points, the plotted burndown represents a projected
burndown, based on past burndown.
Configure and monitor sprint burndown

） Important
Deleting Area Paths or reconfiguring Iteration Paths causes irreversible data
loss. For example, burndown and burnup widget charts, sprint burndown, and
velocity charts for teams with changed Area Paths won't display accurate
data. Historical trend charts reference the Area Path and Iteration Path as
they were defined at the time for each work item. Once deleted, you can't
retrieve historical data for these paths.
You can only delete area and iteration paths that are no longer used by any
work items.

Track your work by using managed
queries in Azure Boards
Article • 10/10/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
List bugs, user stories, or other work items based on field criteria you specify using
queries. You can then review these lists with your team, triage work, or bulk update work
items. Along with managed queries, the semantic search tool provides some
overlapping and different functionality worth exploring.
Use managed queries to support these operations:
Bulk update of work items using the web portal
Triage and update work items
Review a hierarchy of work items
Share a list of work items with a team member
You can create queries and query folders from the web portal or from Visual Studio
Team Explorer. Changes you make in one client are reflected in other clients as all
changes are stored in the work tracking data store.
If you're just getting started, read View, run, or email a work item query. For a quick
reference to query editor tasks and sample queries, see Query quick reference.
To find work items that are assigned to you, add the @Me macros as the value for
the Assigned To field in one of the query clauses.
All valid users with standard access can create queries and folders under the My
Queries area. To create queries and query folders under Shared Queries, have the
Contribute permission set. For more information, see Set permissions on queries.
You can modify any query by adding criteria to focus on a product area, an
iteration, or another field. To modify a query, open the query editor.
You can open any query in Excel. You can also update the fields of one or more
work items and publish your changes to the database for tracking work items.
You can visualize status or progress by creating a pie-chart, column chart, or trend
chart for flat-list queries.

are imported as a flat list as modifying multiple types of links isn't a supported
feature in Excel.

Only you can view and run queries that you save under My Queries with the queries
directory. Also, you can favorite one of these queries to have it appear within your query
selector.
Queries you and others save under Shared Queries can be viewed by everyone with
access to the project. Shared queries can be organized within folders and favorited by
you or for a team. Also, you can set permissions on the folders and queries to prevent
others from moving or editing them.
For more information, see:
Manage queries & query folders
Set query permissions
Favorite a query and Set personal or team favorites
The Queries page contains a Favorites and an All tab. Each contains a directory-focused
view that you can filter to find specific queries of interest.
When you're working in the Queries pages, you can go to a folder, subfolder, or a query
page.

Run a semantic work item search
Article • 11/27/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
You can find work items by using shortcut filters or by specifying keywords or phrases.
You can also use specific fields/field values, assignment or date modifications, or using
Equals, Contains, and Not operators. Searching isn't case-sensitive. Use semantic
searches when you want to do the following tasks:
Find a specific work item using its ID or a keyword
Find one or more work items across all projects in a fast, flexible manner
Run a full text search across all work item fields
Review work items assigned to a specific team member
Search against specific work item fields to quickly narrow down a list of work items
Determine what key words support a managed search
Access levels: All project members: Every project member can use the search
functions, including users with Stakeholder, Basic, and higher levels of access.
Search results:
Access-based results: When you're searching across the organization or
collection, only results for which a project member has access are listed.
Stakeholder limitations:
Wiki search: Stakeholder wiki search results are limited to provisioned wikis.
Published wiki results don’t appear because they require access to regular
repositories, which Stakeholders don’t have.
Code search: Code search results don’t appear for Stakeholders.
With semantic search you can search:
Across one or more projects
Across all work item fields using free text
Against specific work item fields
Free text search easily searches across all work item fields, including custom fields,
resulting in more natural searches. Search results are displayed in a snippet view where
Prerequisites
Start a semantic search for work items


# Page 962

the search matches found are highlighted. Semantic search also integrates with work
item tracking, providing familiar controls to view, edit, comment, and share information
within a work item form.
1. Choose any Boards page, enter a keyword or phrase in the search box, and press
Enter or choose the 
 start search icon.
2. Search results are displayed in a snippet view where the matches found are shown
in bold.
This search is a full text search that uses simple search strings for words or phrases.
Work item search matches derived forms of your search terms; for example, a
search for "updating" also finds instances of the word "updated" and "update".
Searches aren't case-sensitive.
3. Select a snippet of a work item and display it in the right window.
Open the search results in a new browser tab from a search box by pressing Ctrl +
Enter or by holding Ctrl and clicking the 
 icon. In Google Chrome, press Ctrl +
Shift + Enter to switch the focus to the new browser tab.


# Page 963

1. Fine-tune your search by specifying the fields to search. Enter a:  and a user name
to search for all items assigned to that user.
The quick filters you can use are:
a:  for Assigned to:
c:  for Created by:
s:  for State
t:  for Work item type
2. Start entering the name of a field in your work items; for example, type ta .
Fine-tune semantic search results


# Page 964

The dropdown list shows work item field name suggestions that match user input
and help the user to complete the search faster. For example, a search such as
tags:Critical  finds all work items tagged "Critical".
3. Add more filters to further narrow your search, and use Boolean operators to
combine terms if necessary. For example, a: Chris t: Bug s: Active  finds all
active bugs assigned to a user named "Chris".
4. Narrow your search to specific types and states, by using the drop-down selector
lists at the top of the results page.

You can combine shortcuts and use search operators within the search box.
Use the 
 Clear button to remove content from the search box. To switch your context
to the search box from within Visual Studio, enter Ctrl+'.
Keywords or phrases that you type into the search box return a list of work items that
contain those keywords or phrases in the Description, Repro Steps, or Title fields.
Enclose each phrase in quotation marks.
In the Search work items box, type a keyword or phrase that appears in the Title,
Description, or Repro Steps fields for the work items of interest.
Enclose multiple words in quotation marks.
For example, to find work items with the specified keywords in the Title or Description
fields:
For the keyword "duplication", enter duplication.
For the phrase "Getting Started", enter "Getting Started".
For the phrase "Getting Started" or the keyword "feature", enter feature "Getting
Started".
Find items based on keywords or phrases


# Page 966

Filter for items that contain these keywords or phrases:
Enter the following string:
Duplication
duplication
Getting Started
"Getting Started"
Feature and Getting Started
feature "Getting Started"
You can run partial or exact match queries on a keyword or a phrase contained within
any text field. Or, you can run a full-text search query by filtering on keywords and
phrases contained within the full-text search index. Team Foundation automatically
indexes all long-text fields with a data type of PlainText and HTML and the Title field for
full-text search.
To find work items based on a keyword or phrase contained within other text string
fields, specify either the friendly name or the reference name of the field. Enclose each
phrase in quotation marks. You can determine the friendly name of a field by hovering
over the field within a work item form. To determine the reference name of commonly
used fields or to find a field that isn't listed on the form, see Work item field index.
Filter for items that meet this criteria:
Enter the following string:
Contains one attached file.
System.AttachedFileCount=1
Cut user stories.
T:Story Reason=Cut
Or
T="User Story" System.Reason=Cut
Resolved by Peter.

The @Me macro expands to the full name of the current user in any work item search.
The @Me macro is especially useful for creating a search that you can share with other
users, and it can simplify your work by reducing the number of characters you must type
to specify your own user name. For a description of all macros, see Query fields,
operators, and macros, Query macros or variables.

Some fields, such as History and Description, do not support partial word text
searches. For example, if the History field contains the phrase reproducible
behavior  and you search for History:repro  the work item isn't found. However, if
you search for the complete string History:reproducible  the work item is found.
Use @Me or @Today macros


# Page 968

Created yesterday under the Phone Saver team
Created Date=@Today-1 And Area Path=FabrikamFiber\Phone Saver
Use the following search operators to specify search criteria:
= (EQUALS) to search for exact matches of text.
: (CONTAINS) to search for partial matches of text.
- (NOT) to exclude work items that contain certain text. The NOT operator can only be
used with field names.
The following examples show how to use operators when you create a search string.
Filter for items that meet this criteria:
Enter the following string:

Visual Studio 2019 | Visual Studio 2022
To locate work items assigned to you or your team, you can run a query. Your process
could include several predefined queries that you can access and run. Often, it's easier
to create a new query by modifying an existing query definition.
Access levels:
To view and run shared queries, be a project member.
To add and save a shared query, have at least Basic access.
Permissions: Have your Contribute permission set to Allow for the folder that you
want to add a query to. By default, the Contributors group doesn't have this
permission.
From your project, choose Boards > Queries, and then choose All.
７ Note
The browser images used in this article are from the New Boards Hub feature,
which is enabled by default. If this feature isn't enabled, you might be using the
previous boards experience. To display the images for the previous experience,
select the Azure DevOps Server 2022 version of this article.
Prerequisites

Define a work item query
Article • 10/17/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Visual Studio 2019 | Visual Studio 2022
Work item queries in Azure Boards generate lists of work items based on the filter
criteria provided by you. You can save and share these managed queries with others.
You can create queries from the web portal or from a supported client, such as Visual
Studio Team Explorer. To support bulk updates or additions, import or export queries
using Excel or .csv files.
Check out our recommended best practices, later in this article.
Access levels:
To view and run shared queries, be a project member.
To add and save a shared query, have at least Basic access.
Permissions: Have your Contribute permission set to Allow for the folder that you
want to add a query to. By default, the Contributors group doesn't have this
permission.
７ Note
The browser images used in this article are from the New Boards Hub feature,
which is enabled by default. If this feature isn't enabled, you might be using the
previous boards experience. To display the images for the previous experience,
select the Azure DevOps Server 2022 version of this article.
Prerequisites
７ Note
Users with Stakeholder access for a public project have full access to query features
just like users with Basic access. For more information, see Stakeholder access
quick reference.

Managed queries don't support proximity searches, however semantic searches do.
Semantic searches also support both *  and ?  as wildcard characters and you can
use more than one wildcard character to match more than one character. For more
information, see Functional work item search.


# Page 980

You can interactively filter a query using the 
 Filter function.
From your project, choose Boards > Queries, and then choose All.
The Queries page opens to the Favorites tab that lists the queries you set as
favorites. You can choose the All tab to view all queries you defined and shared
queries for the project.
Start a new query from the Queries tab in the web portal or the Work Items tab in Team
Explorer.
1. Select New > New query.

Define a flat-list query
Browser


# Page 981

The Query Editor displays with the following default settings: Flat list of work items,
Work Item Type=[Any], and State=[Any].
2. Modify the Values and add or remove clauses, or change the Type of query to
Work items and direct links or to a Tree of work items.
New queries scope to the current project by default. But, you can create queries to find
work items defined within the organization or project collection. All queries that you
save, however, get saved under a specific project.
To list work items defined in two or more projects, checkmark Query across
projects. For example, the following query finds all features created in all projects
within the last 30 days.
Query across or within projects
Browser


# Page 982

With the Query across projects checked, you can add the Team Project field to
filter to a select number of projects.
The Team Project field is available only after you check Query across projects.
When Query across projects is checked, all fields from all work item types
defined in all projects in the collection appear in the Field drop-down menu.
７ Note
Separate multiple project names with the list separator that corresponds
to the regional settings defined for your client computer, for example, a
comma , .
When you use the 'State' field in a query across multiple projects, the
displayed values are limited to those defined in the default project. This
means that if you're querying across projects, you might not see all
possible state values from each project, but only those from the project
that is set as the default. For example, if you have three projects—Project
A, Project B, and Project C—and only Project A has a state called 'In
Review,' while Projects B and C have different states, querying across
these projects only shows the states defined in Project A.


# Page 983

When Query across projects is unchecked, only those fields from those work
item types, as defined in the current project, appear in the Field drop-down
menu.
To create a query, define one or more clauses. Each clause defines a filter criteria for a
single field.
And/Or
Field
Operator
Value
And
Assigned To
=
@Me
For a list of available operators based on the field data type, see Query index quick
reference.
All clauses get added as an And statement. Select Or to change the grouping. Group
clauses to ensure that the clause statements are run in the sequence required.
Select Add new clause to add another clause at the end of the query, and then
select the Field, Operator, and Value for that clause.

# Page 984

For example, search for all work items assigned to you by specifying the Assigned
To field, the equals (=) operator, and the @Me macro, which represents your user
identity.
1. In the first empty row, under the Field column heading, choose the down arrow to
display the list of available fields, and choose an item in the list. For more
information, see Query Fields and Values.
2. In the same row, under the Operator column heading, select the down arrow to
display the list of available operators, and then choose an item in the list. For more
information, see Operators.
3. In the same row, under the Value column heading, either enter a value, or select
the down arrow, and then choose an item in the list. For more information about
how to use a macro or variable to specify the current project, user, date, or other
selection, see Variables.
4. To add a clause, choose Add new clause.
You can add a clause to the end of the query, or perform the following tasks with
the corresponding icons:
 Insert new filter line
 Remove this filter line
 Group selected clauses
 Ungroup clauses
Use the 
 Tree of Work Items query to view a multi-tiered, nested list of work items.
For example, you can view all backlog items and their linked tasks. To focus on different
parts of the tree, choose 
 Expand all or 
 Collapse all.
 Tip
To view the WIQL syntax for a query, and how parenthesis are used to group
clauses, install the Marketplace Wiql Editor
. This extension supports viewing the
WIQL syntax and exporting it to a WIQL file for use in REST API calls. For more
information, see Syntax for the Work Item Query Language (WIQL).
Checklist for defining a query clause
Use a work item tree to view hierarchies


# Page 985

Define the filter criteria for both parent and child work items. To find linked
children, select Match top-level work items first. To find linked parents, select
Match linked work items first.
７ Note
You can't construct a query that shows a hierarchical view of Test Plans, Test Suites,
and Test Cases. These items aren't linked together using parent-child link types.
However, you can create a direct links query that lists test-related work items. Also,
you can, view the hierarchy through the Test Plans page.
Browser


# Page 986

Use the 
 Work items and Direct links query to track work items that depend on other
tracked work, such as tasks, bugs, issues, or features. For example, you can view backlog
items that depend on other items being implemented or a bug being fixed.
Use the direct links query to track dependencies across teams. The query also helps you
manage commitments your team makes. Choose the filter criteria for the top and linked
work items. And, select the types of links to filter the dependencies.
Use direct links to view dependencies
Browser


# Page 987

Filter your first-tier list of work items by choosing one of these options:
Only return items that have matching links: First-tier work items return, but
only if they have links to work items specified by the linked work items filter
criteria.
Return all top level items: All first-tier work items return despite the linked
work items filter criteria. Second-tier work items that are linked to the first tier
return if they match the linked work items filter criteria.
Only return items that do not have matching links: First-tier work items are
returned, but only if they don't have links to work items specified by the linked
work items filter criteria.
For more information about each link type, see Link type reference.
Specify And  or Or  to create logical expressions of your query clauses. Use And  to find
work items that meet the criteria in both the current clause and the previous clause. Use
Or  to find work items that meet the criterion in either the current clause or the previous
clause.
Use and/or logical expression


# Page 988

Add one new clause for each work item field to refine your search criteria. Add clauses
to return only the set of work items you want. If you don't receive the results you expect
from your query, refine it. You can add, remove, group, or ungroup query clauses to
improve your query results.
Group query clauses to operate as a single unit separate from the rest of the query.
Grouping clauses is similar to putting parentheses around an expression in a
mathematical equation or logic statement. When you group clauses, the And  or Or  for
the first clause in the group applies to the whole group.
Grouped clauses operate as a single unit separate from the rest of the query. Grouping
clauses is similar to putting parentheses around a mathematical equation or logic
expression. The And  or Or  operator for the first clause in the group applies to the whole
group.
As the following examples show, the grouped clauses are translated to the
corresponding logical expression.

These queries return work items that are type Bug and meet the following logical
expressions:
Query 1: AND State=Active OR Assigned to @Me
Query 2: AND (State=Active OR Assigned to @Me)
Query 3: OR (State=Active AND Assigned to @Me)
To group one or more clauses, select them and then select the 
 group clauses icon.
You can also group several grouped clauses. Check the boxes of each clause. Then,
choose the 
 group clauses icon.
If your query results don't return expected results, do the following steps:
Make sure that each clause is defined as you intended.
Verify And / Or  assignments to each clause. If your results contain more work items
than expected, often an Or  clause is present instead of an And  clause.
Determine if you need to group or change the grouping of the query clauses and
the And / Or  assignments of each grouped clause.
Add more query clauses to refine your query filter criteria.
Review the options available to specify fields, operators, and values.
See best practices, later in this article.
Ungroup a clause


# Page 990

To ungroup a clause, select the 
 ungroup clauses icon for the grouped clause.
To set the default column width in query results, do the following steps:
1. Open the query you want to modify.
2. Manually adjust the column widths to your desired size by dragging the edges of
the column headers.
3. Select Save or Save As if you want to save it as a new query.
4. Close and reopen the query to ensure that the column widths are retained.
Azure DevOps doesn't currently support setting a default column width that persists
across all sessions. The column widths are saved per query, so you need to adjust and
save them for each query individually.
The following two widgets display query results. You can open work items directly from
these widgets.
Work assigned to me: Lists all proposed or active work items assigned to the
signed-in user. Lists the ID, State, and Title fields.
Query results widget: Displays the results of a flat, tree, or direct-links query. You
can configure the fields displayed through the widget, resize the column fields, and
expand and collapse tree and direct-links query.
For more information, see Add widgets to a dashboard.
You can view the results of a query with the Parent title displayed. To do so, perform
these steps:
1. Create the query that filters the work items of interest. The query can be a flat-list,
tree, or direct-links query.
2. Add the Parent field as a column.
3. Save the query as a Shared query or Team favorite.
4. Add the Query results widget to your dashboard and configure the query. Make
sure the Parent field is set to display.
The following image illustrates a query results widget that displays the Parent field.

A query hyperlink uses the Work Item Query Language (WIQL), which resembles
Transact-SQL. For more information, see Syntax for the Work Item Query Language
(WIQL).
Encode the WIQL portion of the URL syntax. You can use any URL encoder tool to
encode your URL.
Define a query as a hyperlink
７ Note
Most browsers enforce a limit of between 2000 and 2083 characters for a URL
string.

# Page 992

For example, the following hyperlink lists the ID and title of all active bugs defined under
the FabrikamFiber/Web area path for the Fabrikam organization.
The decoded WIQL conforms to:
wiql
The following best practices apply to the following queries you can create:
Web portal queries
Work Item Query Language (WIQL) queries
az boards query command line
REST API queries
Define a highly selective query by applying all filters that are necessary for your query.
The more selective the query is, the smaller the set of results. The smaller the result set
is, the more targeted and selective your query is.
https://dev.azure.com/fabrikam/FabrikamFiber/_workitems?
_a=query&wiql=SELECT%20%5BSystem.ID%5D%2C%20%5BSystem.Title%5D%20FROM%20Work

SELECT [System.ID], [System.Title]
   FROM WorkItems 
   WHERE [System.TeamProject]='FabrikamFiber' 
   AND [System.WorkItemType]='Bug'
   AND [System.State]='Active'
   AND [System.AreaPath]='FabrikamFiber\Web'
７ Note
The WIQL length must not exceed 32K characters for Azure Boards queries.
Best practices
Create focused, selective queries
Use tags to categorize work items


# Page 993

Use work item tags to categorize your work items instead of a custom field. Queries that
filter on tags usually perform faster over those queries that filter on string matches.
Unlike custom field matches or partial matches, a query with a Tags Contains  operation
doesn't require a complete scan of all work item tables.
To filter on a string match, use the Contains Words  instead of the Contains  operator.
The Contains Words  operator runs a full-text search on the specified field, which tends
to complete more quickly.
The Contains  operator runs a table scan, which is a slower operation than the Contains
Words  operator. It also consumes more CPU cycles. These CPU cycles can cause you to
encounter rate limitations. For more information, see Rate and usage limits.
The In Group  operator filters work items based on matches within a group of values.
The group of values correspond to the values contained within a team, security group,
or work tracking category. For example, you can create a query to find all work items
that are assigned to any member of a team. Or, find all work items that belong to the
requirements category ( Microsoft.RequirementCategory ).
When you filter on a group that contains a large number of members, your result set
tends to be larger and nonselective. Also, if a group corresponds to a large Microsoft
Entra group, the query generates a fairly large cost to resolve that group from Microsoft
Entra ID.
Negated operators—such as <>, Not In, Not Under, Not In Group —tend to generate
nonselective queries and large result sets.
Only use negated operators when necessary. Always try to find alternatives first. For
example, if Field1 has values A, B, C, D; specify the Field1 In A, B, C  clause, instead of
the negated Field1 <> D  clause.
Use Contains words  for string matches
Specify small groups with the In Group  operator
Avoid use of negated operators
Avoid string comparisons


# Page 994

Feedback
Queries that contain string comparisons generate table scans that are inherently
inefficient. Instead, we recommend you use tags or a specific custom field as
alternatives, particularly when a query performs poorly.
Limit the number of Or  operators defined in your query. Queries run better when fewer
Or  operators are used. Too many Or  operators can make your query nonselective. If
your query runs slowly, reorder the Or  operator clause towards the top of the query
clauses.
Due to internal optimizations, saved queries tend to perform better over unsaved
queries. Always save your query when you plan to reuse it. Even for WIQL queries run
through a REST API, save the WIQL through the web portal to make your REST API calls,
so they're less prone to future performance regressions.
Sometimes you need to run your query a few times to reach the right optimization plan.
Make sure to save your query and run it up to 10 times over a 30-minute period. This
way, the system can examine and seek out the optimization plan that's most appropriate
for your query.

Track progress with status and trend
query-based charts
Article • 09/23/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
You can quickly view the status of work in progress by charting the results of a flat-list
query. Queries support different chart views, such as pie, column, pivot, or trend. Charts
support viewing a count of work items or a sum of values for select numeric fields, such
as Story Points, Effort, or Remaining Work. Group work by State, Assigned To, or other
custom or system defined field.
In this article you learn how to perform the following tasks:
For example, the following image illustrates two different charts created from the same
flat-list query. The pie chart groups the 19 bugs by state, and the bar chart groups the
bugs by assignment and their current status.

When creating a query to support your chart, follow these guidelines.
Always select the Flat list of work items query type. Other query types aren't
supported for charting. For more information, see Define a flat-list query.
Add those fields to either a query clause or the column options that you want to
use within your chart. You can group charts by any field except date-time, free-
form text, and tag fields. For example:
To group by status, include the State field.
To group by work assignments, include the Assigned To field.
To group by sprints or iterations, include the Iteration Path.
To group by team, include the Node Name field that displays the leaf node of
the Area Path.
To group by a custom field, include it.
To sum a numeric column, include the corresponding field in your query clause or
column options. For more examples of charts created from numeric fields, see
Query by numeric fields.
If you plan to add your query to a dashboard, save your query as a Shared query.
You can't group charts by the following field data types:
ID
Date-time, such as Created Date, Changed Date
Plain text, such as Title
Rich-text, such as Description, Repro Steps
Tags

７ Note
You can't group a query-based chart by tags, however, you can group a Chart for
Work Items widget by tags that you add to a dashboard as described in Configure
a chart for work items widget.
Display of areas and iterations


# Page 1008

When you select Area Path or Iteration Path, only the leaf node appears in the chart.
The leaf node is the last node of the full path. For example, Phone  is the leaf node of
FabrikamFiber/Fabrikam Website/Phone . If your query contains a mixed level of leaf
nodes, your chart might not reflect expected results.
Select the Node Name field, the area path leaf node, to see if that improves your results.
Charts display in browsers that support Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). Supported
browsers include Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer 9 and later versions, Chrome, Firefox
and Safari on Mac. Charts aren't optimized for mobile or touch displays.
Most charts allow you to choose how you want to sort the data. You can sort by Value
or Label and select Ascending or Descending.
Value: Sorts data by the numeric value
Label: Sorts by the label selected for grouping the data
When a chart contains more than 8 or 12 items within the data series, values in the 9 or
13-plus items are consolidated into a set labeled (other). However, if you increase the
chart size through the configurable widget on a dashboard you can increase the series
limit.
７ Note
Internet Explorer is no longer supported for Azure DevOps Services or for Azure
DevOps Server 2020.1.

All team members can view charts saved under Shared Queries, except members
with Stakeholder access. You can add those charts to dashboards.
Only you can view queries under your My Queries folder.
You can copy and email the URL of any chart page to share it with a project
member.
To create similar charts for tests, see Track test status.
1. From Queries, open the chart editor for a flat-list query. To create charts, belong to
the Contributors group.
If you have Stakeholder access, the Charts and New Chart links don't appear.
2. Select the chart type and field for grouping values. When you use pie, bar, and
column charts, select a single field to view a count of work items.

# Page 1010

If you don't see the field you want in the Group by dropdown list, add the field as
a column to the query and save the query. Also, the Aggregation options depend
on the fields used in the query or the fields selected from the Column Options.
If you receive an error message when you close the chart editor, you need to
request Basic access. For more information, see Change access levels.
3. To sort the results, select Value or Label as the sort option and then Ascending or
Descending.
To change a color, select a color from the Series set of color pickers.
Charts automatically update when you edit the query or refresh the query results.
Add a Pie chart


# Page 1011

Use a pie chart to show group percentages with six or fewer categories. Good examples
of pie charts are:
Active Bugs Status, group by State
User Story Status, group by State
User Story Progress, group by Completed, In Progress, or Cut
For example, the following query filters User Stories based on the State for Cut, In
Progress, and Completed since the start of the year.
The pie chart configuration is as shown in the following image.
The combined query and chart configuration yield the following pie chart.


# Page 1012

A stacked bar chart lets you track progress against two field values. Node Name displays
the last leaf within an area path. Use this approach when you want to show data across
teams and each node corresponds to a team.
Add a Stacked bar chart


# Page 1013

The Pivot table displays a table of configurable rows and columns, with columns
showing a count of work items or sum of a numeric field. Choose a Pivot table when you
want to compare across areas the work being performed.
The following image shows an example of work item types and their current state.
Trend charts let you view progress over time. You can select a rolling period ranging
from the last week to the last year.
Add a Pivot table
Add a Trend chart


# Page 1014

Trend data is extracted from the work tracking data store. Like most data stores, the
schema of the relational database is designed and optimized for the online transactional
processing of data. As the tool or plug-in performs an activity, it writes the latest
information to the operational store. Data in the operational store is constantly
changing and being updated. All data is current.
Burndown charts are useful for determining how quickly work is progressing based on a
numeric field value, such as Story Points, Effort, or Remaining Work, or on a count of
work items.
To create a burndown chart, add the numeric field you want to your query. To view a
burndown chart of tasks, select the Sum operator for Remaining Work.
Add a Burndown chart


# Page 1015

In addition to query-based burndown charts, you can Configure a burndown or burnup
widget.
Add a chart to a dashboard is through the addition of a Chart for Work Items widget.
You can add the chart to a dashboard as shown in the following procedure, or by adding
the Chart for Work Items widget directly. For more information, see Configure a chart
for work items widget.
Select the 
 actions icon for the chart you want to add, and select Add to
dashboard.
Add chart to a dashboard
 Tip
All query charts are limited in size. You can resize and configure charts that you add
to a dashboard by opening the Chart for Work Items widget used to display them.


# Page 1016

Only queries that are saved to a Shared Queries folder have the Add to dashboard
menu option.
In the dialog that opens, select the dashboard to add the chart to.
To add other types of charts, such as test results and build summary charts, see Add
widgets and chart to a dashboard.

Interactively filter backlogs, boards,
queries, and plans in Azure Boards
Article • 11/22/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Filter functions in Azure Boards empower you to interactively apply one or more filters
to streamline your work item management. Each Azure Boards tool—such as Backlogs,
Boards, and Query results—comes prefiltered to display a relevant subset of work items
based on its specific functionality:
Backlogs and boards: Show work items based on the selected Area Paths and
Iteration Paths for your team.
Query results: List work items that match the query clauses you defined.
To enhance your filtering capabilities, enable the filter feature by selecting the 
 Filter
icon.
Even with these initial filters, you might still encounter a large number of work items.
Interactive filtering allows you to narrow down your view and focus on a specific subset
of work items by applying more filter criteria to each Azure Boards tool.
Filters can significantly enhance your workflow by helping you accomplish the following
tasks:
Daily scrum meetings: Focus the board on work assigned for a specific sprint to
facilitate effective stand-ups.
Sprints Taskboard: Filter to view a particular team member's completed work,
aiding in performance reviews and accountability.
Group work items: Concentrate on related work items by filtering based on Parent
Work Item, Area Path, or Tags, enhancing organization and clarity.
Triage work items: Create and apply queries to isolate similar work items grouped
by Area Path or Tags, enabling efficient issue resolution and backlog grooming.
Use cases for filters


# Page 1019

By using these filter functions, your team can maintain focus, improve productivity, and
ensure that critical tasks receive the attention they deserve.
For more detailed information on using filters, see Filter Backlogs, Boards, and Plans.
Project access: Be a project member.
Filter functions are available from all Azure Boards tools: Work items, Boards, Backlogs,
Sprint Backlogs and Taskboards, Queries, and Delivery Plans. The set of features
supported depends on the tool and Azure DevOps version. (Use the content selector to
view the filters available for your version.)
The following table indicates the supported options based on the tool indicated with a
✔️ or is listed.
Backlogs and boards are subject to filters defined for the team as described in Set up
your Backlogs and Boards. Other tools have predefined filters based on the view, query
filter clauses, or settings you select.

Notes
1. While the Parent Work Item isn't a filter function for Backlogs or Query Results,
you can add the Parent field as a column and then do a keyword/phrase search on
the Parent title to effectively filter on parent work items. The Parent field is
supported for Azure DevOps Server 2020 and later versions. See also the Parent
field and Parent Work Item section later in this article.
2. The Parent Work Item filter is supported for Sprint Backlogs and Taskboards for
Azure DevOps Server 2020 and later versions.
Along with the standard filter functions summarized in the previous table, the following

Notes
1. The Work items page is subject to filters based on the view selected. Boards and
Backlogs are subject to filters defined for the team as described in Set up your
Backlogs and Boards. Completed and In Progress work items get determined
based on the state categories assigned to the workflow state as described in How
workflow states and state categories are used in Backlogs and Boards.
2. Grouping is supported through portfolio backlogs and boards, parent-child links,
and tree hierarchy. Tree hierarchies are flattened when filtering is applied and
reinstated when filtering is cleared.
3. Backlogs and Sprint Backlogs support reordering. However, when filtering is
enabled, reordering isn't supported.
4. Taskboards provides a Group by function based on People or Stories.
5. Query Results supports multi-column sort.
6. Work items appear in the order defined for the team Sprint backlog, which it
inherits from the team product backlog.
7. Semantic search supports sorting search results by the following fields—Assigned
To, Changed Date, Created Date, ID, State, Tags, Title, and Work Item Type—and
Relevance.
For more information about these other functions, see the following articles:

# Page 1025

The Parent Work Item filter enables you to focus on one or more select features or
epics. This filter function was added in July 2016 and made available in Azure DevOps
Server 2017 and later versions.
The Parent field was added to Azure Boards in July of 2019 and then made available
with the release of Azure DevOps Server 2020. You can add the Parent field to a list
through the Column Options dialog, except for the Work items tool. You can also add
the Parent field to cards on the boards and Taskboards.
Once you set filter options for a specific view, your settings persist until you modify
them. There's no need to select a save button or take any other actions.
To filter work items based on specific fields, first add the field as a column or to the card.
For example, to filter by Assigned To, Iteration Path, Work Item Type, or any other
field's content, ensure these fields are displayed on the cards, backlog, plan, or list.
All filter configurations are user-specific and remain active until you clear them.
To add columns or fields, see the following articles:
For Backlogs and Queries, see Change column options
For Boards, see Customize cards
For Taskboards, see Customize a sprint Taskboard
For Plans, see Review team delivery plans.
1. From the Azure Boards tool, choose the view you want. For example:
For Work items, select Assigned to me, Following, Mentioned, or other view.
For Backlogs and Boards, select the backlog level you want, such as Stories,
Features, or Epics.
For sprint Backlogs and Taskboards, choose the iteration
For queries, define the query filter criteria of interest.

You can't set default filter options or configure filters for other team members.
Open and clear filter functions


# Page 1026

2. Choose any other view settings available for your view. For example:
For Work items, from the View options menu, enable/disable Completed
Work Items.
For Backlogs, from the View options menu, enable/disable In Progress items
or Completed Child items.
For Taskboards, from the Person menu, choose All, Unassigned, or a specific
team member.
3. For list views, add columns to display fields containing text you want to filter on or
possibly sort on. For card views, add fields to display on cards containing text you
want to filter on.
4. Select Filter 
 . Or, enter the Ctrl+Shift+f keyboard shortcut.
For example, here we open the filter toolbar for the board, Backlog items.
::: moniker-end
5. Choose your filters of interest.
The filter icon changes to a solid icon, Filter 
 , to indicate filtering is applied.
The page refreshes to show only those work items that meet all the selected filter
criteria.
When filtering is applied, the following functions are disabled or altered:
For backlogs, the add-a-backlog-item panel, reordering (stack ranking), and
forecasting tools are disabled.
For backlogs set to Show Parents, the tree hierarchy is flattened, unless you enable
the Keep hierarchy with filters from the View Options menu. See [Filter your
backlog and maintain the hierarchy](#keep hierarchy) provided later in this article.
To clear and dismiss filtering, choose Clear and dismiss filtering 
 .
Inactive functions
Clear or dismiss filtering


# Page 1027

Filters remain in place until you explicitly clear them. When you refresh your backlog,
board, or other tool, or sign in from another browser, filters remain set to your previous
values.
Once the board is filtered, you can choose the filter icon to hide the drop downs and
view the applied filters on the board. The filter icon turns opaque to signify a filtered
board.
You can filter your backlog and maintain the hierarchy of work by choosing show
Parents and Keep hierarchy with filters from the View Options menu. Use these options
when you want to show work items assigned to one or more team members, work item
types, area or iteration paths, or combination of these items and keywords. The
hierarchy is maintained and work items that match the filter criteria are shown in bold
text.
Filter your backlog and maintain the hierarchy


# Page 1028

Applying Boolean operators to filters is only supported for tags, as described in Filter
based on tags later in this article. All other filters are applied with an implicit AND
operator.
The keyword filter allows you to search lists or cards based on the fields configured
through Column Options or board settings. You can filter by specific values, such as IDs
even if the ID field is visible. When using the keyword filter, ensure that the fields
containing the desired text or tags are displayed in your view.
The filter criteria ignore the following characters: ,  (comma), .  (period), /  (forward
slash), and \  (back slash).
Here we filter the board to only show those cards that include 'web' either in the title,
tag, or field.

 Tip
Filtering is case-insensitive.

Filter a board using a keyword


# Page 1029

Here we filter the Backlog with Show Parents enabled, to only show work items that
include 'web'.
The filtered set is always a flat list, even if you selected to show parents.
With filtering turned on, choose one or more values from the multi-select drop-down
menu for each field available to you. The values for these fields are populated as follows:
Area: The Node Name, which specifies the last node of an Area Path, of valid Area
Paths and for which there are work items assigned to that Area Path
Assigned To: All users who are currently assigned to work items on the board plus
Unassigned
Iteration: All Iteration Paths selected for the current team and for which there are
work items assigned to that iteration
Work item type: Work item types defined for the Requirements Category (product
backlog) or Features or Epic categories (feature or epic portfolio backlogs), subject
to work items being assigned to the work item types
Tags: All tags assigned to work items on the board
Parent Work Items: All features defined for the team, or all epics defined for the
team when viewing the Features board
Filter a backlog by using a keyword
Filter based on a field
７ Note


# Page 1030

You can filter by select field values using the board for your product backlog (Stories,
Product Backlog Items, or Requirements) or a portfolio backlog (Features or Epics).
For example, here we filter for all items assigned to Jamal and Raisa.
Cards are filtered based on the assignments made in the following order and logic:
1. Assigned to: Show all cards that are assigned to user 1 OR  user 2 AND
2. Iteration: Show all cards that are assigned to Iteration 1 OR  Iteration 2 AND
3. Work Item type: Show all cards that are work item type 1 OR  work item type 2 AND
4. Tags: Show all cards that have tag 1 AND  or OR  tags 2, based on your selection of
AND | OR . AND
5. Parent Work Items: Show all cards that have Parent Work Item 1 OR  Parent Work
Item 2.
Filter options are dependent on the work items that meet the filter criteria. For
example, if you don't have any work items assigned to Sprint 4, then the Sprint 4
option won't appear in the filter options for the Iteration Path.
The values that populate the filter options are based on the work items that are
currently loaded and displayed. For example, if you have a backlog with 2,000 work
items, but only 1,000 are displayed on a board, the filter options are based on just
the items displayed.
Filter a board by using select field values
Board filter logic


# Page 1031

Here we show a filtered backlog based on the keyword "issues." Filtered pages show the
 filtered icon. The filtered set is always a flat list, even if you selected to show a
hierarchical backlog view.
You can use the Filter by parent feature to filter by select parent work items using the
board for your product backlog (Stories, Product Backlog Items, or Requirements) or a
portfolio backlog (Features).
Use this feature only when you created features or epics and linked them to user stories
or features, respectively. A quick and easy way to create the links is to map them using
drag-and-drop. Mapping creates parent-child links between the work items.
To start filtering, choose Filter 
 . Choose one or more values from the multi-select
drop-down menu for the Parent Work Item. These values are derived from the Features
you defined.
Here, we choose two features on which to filter the board:
Filter a backlog by using fields
Filter based on the Parent Work Item
７ Note
The Filter by parent feature doesn't support filtering of parent work items of the
same work item type. For example, you can't filter the Stories backlog by specifying
user stories that are parents of nested user stories.


# Page 1032

The final board displays just those stories linked as child work items to the selected
features.
If you added tags to your work items, you can filter your work using one or more tags.
For backlogs and query results, add Tags as a column option before filtering on tags.
Check the boxes of those tags that you want to filter on. Keep the OR selection to do a
logical OR for all the tags you selected. Or, choose the AND option to do a logical AND
on all the selected tags.
Filter based on tags


# Page 1033

For more information about tags, see Add tags to work items to categorize and filter
lists and boards.
In addition to all the filter features described earlier in this article, you can also filter the
history view within a work item form.
To quickly find revisions made that contain a keyword, or made by specific people or to
a specific field, enable the filter feature by choosing 
 Toggle filter.

# Page 1044

1. From your project, select Boards > Queries > All > Shared Queries.
2. Select New folder.
3. Enter the name for the folder and select the parent folder from the drop-down list.
This example uses the name the folder Service Delivery with the intention that it
gets used by the Service Delivery team.
 Tip
To rename or move a shared query or folder, have Delete permissions and
Contribute permissions for the folder where you move the query to.


# Page 1045

4. To set permissions for the new folder, select More actions 
 > Security.
5. Change the permissions so that the team member or group can contribute and
manage permissions for the folder. Enter the name of a user or group within the
search box.
This example adds the Service Delivery team and grant them permissions to create
and manage permissions to all queries and folders under the Service Delivery
folder.


# Page 1046

Contribute allows team members to create and edit queries and folders under the
folder where the permissions were granted. And, Manage Permissions allows team
members to manage the permission settings on queries and subfolders.
6. (Optional) Turn off inheritance. Default is On. By turning off inheritance for a
folder, you disallow inheritance of permissions that exist up the chain of query
folders. For more information, see Permissions, Inheritance.
7. Close the dialog when you're done.
8. Reopen the Security dialog and choose Service Delivery and verify that the
permissions are set.


# Page 1047

To keep anyone else from modifying a shared query that you create, you might want to
set permissions on a specific query. You can set permissions by opening the permissions
dialog for the specific query.
1. Choose the More actions icon 
 and select Security.
2. Change the permissions so that a team member or group can't edit, delete, or
change permissions for the query.
Here we deny permissions for the Disallow access group.

Manage columns in a work item list in
Azure Boards
Article • 11/22/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Visual Studio 2019 | Visual Studio 2022
Each column corresponds to a work item field. You can add and remove columns within
work item lists to show the fields of interest to you. Or, you can drag a column to a new
position. Your settings persist for each page you customize and are only valid for your
views.
Specifically, you can do the following actions from the following list views:
Action
Backlogs
Sprint backlogs
Queries

You can add most fields listed in the Work item field index. All fields defined within the
project collection or organization are available for selection, even those fields that aren't
used for your particular project. You can view the list of fields defined for your collection
from Organization Settings>Process>Fields
Once you set the column options for a specific view, your settings persist until you
change them. The following notes apply to specific views.
Column options you set for a backlog apply only to the active team and backlog.
Options you set for the product backlog differ from the options you set for a
portfolio backlog.
 Tip
Unlike a query result, you can't sort a backlog by a column. However, you can use
the Create Query link on each backlog to create a query that you can sort on any
field column you choose from the Sorting tab of the Column options dialog. While
you may be able to add a field to sort on, not all fields are supported. For example,
selection of the Parent, History, Description, or other rich-text field results in the
display of an error message as you can't sort on these fields.
About persistence of column options


# Page 1051

Column options you set for a Sprint backlog persist for all sprints you select until
you change them.
Column options you set for a query persist when you save the query.
Column options you set for one of the supported Work items views persists for a
specific view only, such as Assigned to me, Following, Mentioned, and so on.
Project access: Be a project member
Permissions:
Be a member of the Contributors or Project Administrators security group.
To view or modify work items, have your View work items in this node and Edit
work items in this node permissions set to Allow. By default, the Contributors
group has this permission set to Allow. For more information, see Set work
tracking permissions.
Access levels: To add or modify work items, have at least Basic access. Users with
Stakeholder access for public projects have full access to backlog and board
features, like users with Basic access. For more information, see Stakeholder access
quick reference.
Defined iterations: To use the Planning pane, ensure your team administrator
defined iteration (sprint) paths and configure team iterations.
Start by opening the Column Options dialog. If you don't see the option, choose the …
and choose from the options provided.
７ Note
You can't set column options for other members of your team, nor can you set
default column options.

Import, update, and export bulk work
items with CSV files in Azure Boards
Article • 11/27/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Import and export work items in bulk using CSV-formatted files in Azure Boards. While
you can continue to use Excel for bulk imports and updates, the native import/export
feature allows you to manage work items without requiring Excel. For more information,
see Bulk add or modify work items with Excel.
Permissions:
Export work items: Be a member of the Project Administrators security group or
have View project-level information set to Allow.
Import work items: Be a member of the Project Administrators security group or
the Team Foundation Administrators security group.
To import work items in bulk, your CSV file must include the Work Item Type and Title
fields. You can include more fields as needed. Follow these guidelines to import a CSV
file:
Exclude the ID field: Don't include the ID field in your CSV file.
Remove project-specific fields: If the CSV file was exported from a different
project, remove fields specific to the source project, such as Area Path and Tags.
For a list of default fields, see Work Item Field Index.
Include the Test Steps field: When importing test cases, include the Test Steps
field. For more information, see Bulk Import or Export Test Cases.
Don't include Assigned To, Changed Date, Created By, or State fields.
Validate required fields:
Ensure the Work Item Type and Title fields are present in the CSV file.
Confirm that the Work Item Type corresponds to a valid type in the target
project.
Verify that all fields in the CSV file match the fields for the work item types in
the target project.
Prerequisites
Import new work items


# Page 1057

Handle invalid values: If the imported CSV file contains work items with invalid
values, you must edit and correct these work items after import before they can be
saved.
Do the following steps to import new work items.
1. Create a local import.csv file and open it in Visual Studio Code or Excel.
2. The file must contain the Work Item Type and the Title fields. You can include
other fields as needed. For a list of default fields, see Work item field index.
The following example includes the Priority field.
csv
3. From the web portal for your project, select Boards > Queries > Import work
items.
７ Note
You can import up to 1,000 work items at a time. If you have more than 1,000 work
items to import, break them into multiple files and import them separately.
Work Item Type,Title,Priority
Issue,Fix issues with code,1
Issue,Merge testing modules,3
Issue,Open private preview for select customers,2
Issue,Enable feature for customer champs,2
Issue,Remove old test code,2


# Page 1058

4. Select Choose file, choose your file, and then select Import.
The import process loads the imported work items into the queries view in an
unsaved state. No IDs get assigned.
5. Verify the results and then select Save items to save the work items.


# Page 1059

6. The system highlights those work items with data issues. Resolve the data issues
before you save the work items. In this example, an invalid value is in the Priority
field. Fix the data by opening the work item directly. Instead, use bulk edit to fix
several work items with the same issue.
Parent-child links: You can add parent-child links between work items you import
by indenting the title columns, as shown in Can I import a CSV file that have
parent-child links?. However, you can't specify any other link types when you
import or update work items.
Default State field: When you import new work items, the State field is set to New
by default. You can't specify a different state during the import process. If you
need to change the state of imported work items, use the following workaround:
1. Import the work items with the default New state.
2. Export the imported work items to a CSV file.
3. Update the State field values in the exported CSV file.
4. Reimport the updated CSV file to set the desired states.
Default Area and Iteration fields: The Area and Iteration fields default to the top-
level node. This behavior occurs because the import process doesn't have the
context for these fields unless explicitly specified in the CSV file. To set specific
Area and Iteration paths during import, ensure these fields are included in your
CSV file with the correct values. For example:
 Tip
Don't assign IDs to new work items that you add. Assigning IDs results in an
error message.
Tips


# Page 1060

csv
1. To update work items, create a query that contains all the columns you want to
export and possibly edit. Save your query and select Export to CSV to save the
data.csv file to your local machine.
The exported file should look similar to the following example:
csv
2. Make the edits to your work items. Your CSV file must contain the ID, Work Item
Type, and Title fields. Any other fields you want to include are optional.
Title,Description,Area Path,Iteration Path
"Sample Work Item","This is a sample 
description.","Project\Team","Project\Sprint 1"
Update existing work items
ID,Work Item Type,Title,Assigned To,State,Tags
"272","Issue","Fix issues with code","Active","",
"273","Issue","Merge testing modules","Active","",
"274","Issue","Open private preview for select customers","Active","",
"275","Issue","Enable feature for customer champs","Active","",
"276","Issue","Remove old test code","Active","",
７ Note
When you import identity fields, enter the name and email in the following
format "Display Name <email>" . For example, to assign work to Jamal


# Page 1061

In the following example, we change values on existing working items.
csv
3. Save the file and import, as described in the previous section.
4. The results list with work items that contain value changes appear highlighted in
bold. Select Save Items to apply the changes.
5. Work items with data issues get highlighted in red and must be resolved before
you can save them. In this example, an invalid value appears in the Assigned To
field. Fix the data by opening the work item directly. You can use bulk edit if you
have many work items with the same issue.
Hartnett, specify "Jamal Hartnett <fabrikamfiber4@hotmail.com>" . If you
specify a value that isn't recognized as a valid user to the system, you may
encounter problems with the import.
ID,Work Item Type,Title,Assigned To,State,Tags
"272","Issue","Fix issues with code","Jamal Hartnett 
<fabrikamfiber4@hotmail.com>","Active",
"273","Issue","Merge testing modules","Jamal Hartnett

# Page 1062

From any query, you can export a list of work items as a comma-delimited list. Open the
query, select the 
 actions icon, and then select Export to CSV.
You can use this feature to export work items from one project and import them to
another project. But, before you import them to another project, you must remove the
work item ID. You get an error if you attempt to import new work items to a project with
an ID specified.
HTML fields, such as descriptions and acceptance criteria, include rich text formatting. To
ensure this formatting is preserved, do the following tasks:
Export list as a CSV file
Export and import work items to a different
project
Import HTML fields


# Page 1063

1. Ensure your CSV file includes HTML tags within the relevant fields.
2. Import the CSV file into Excel.
Excel might handle multi-line text fields differently, so it's important to check the
formatting after import. Replace lines ending in CRLF  by surrounding sentences with
<p>... </p> .
For example, you can import the following work item, which includes three lines of text
in the Description field.
csv
To disable HTML in multi-line fields to ensure that they're plaintext, use the witadmin
changefield  command. For more information, see Manage Work Item Fields.
Example command:
Windows Command Prompt
When you work with HTML fields across different Microsoft products, you might
encounter formatting inconsistencies. Here are some tips to handle these issues:
Review the formatting after importing to ensure it meets your requirements.
Use appropriate HTML tags and structures to minimize discrepancies. You can add
multiple tags separated by a semicolon. For more information, see Tasks you can
and can't do with Excel.
For more information on managing HTML content and ensuring compatibility, see
Provide help text, hyperlinks, or web content on a work item form.

A: You can test by adding tags with spaces and hyphens, for example, and include it in
the export. The import should match the same format. Any problems with the
formatting of your CSV file appear in the Results page of the import view. You can't
import the work items until the formatting and syntax is correct.
The work item results always list the data errors found for individual work items. Fix each
error either from the web portal, or in the CSV file and import again.

A: When you use the Web UI, the identity picker goes through extra steps to validate the
user. First it checks to see if the person is a valid user in the org. If not, it searches on the
identity in Microsoft Entra ID. If the user's in Microsoft Entra ID but not in the org, that
user gets added to the valid identities.
When you import from CSV, for performance reasons, the identity picker doesn't go
through these extra steps. It only checks to see if there's a matching User Principal
Name (UPN) already in the org. If it doesn't find a matching UPN, it reports that the
identity is unknown.

You can add, modify, publish, and refresh work items using any query type and list type.
Use a flat list to bulk add or modify several types of work items at once, such as
backlog items, tasks, bugs, or issues.
Use a tree list to bulk add or modify work items and their tree-topology links.
Follow these best practices:
Input list, flat list: Import a list of work items or create new work items without
hierarchy.
Input list, tree list: Complete top-down planning and import hierarchically linked
work items.
Query list, tree list: View and modify the hierarchy of link relationships of many
existing work items.
Query list, flat list: Bulk update a list of work items or create new work items
without hierarchy.
Query types:
None: Indicates an input list.
Query title: Indicates the list of work items is tied to the specified query.
Azure Boards supports three query types, indicated by icons next to each query:
Flat list of work items: Imported as a flat list query.
Work items and direct links: Imported as a flat list query.
Use list and query types
Query types


# Page 1069

Tree of work items: Imported as a tree list.
Direct links queries are imported as a flat list into Excel, as modifying multiple types of
links isn't supported in Excel.
You can bulk add a nested list of work items, such as a work breakdown structure or
hierarchical user stories. For example, you can add a nested list of tasks, subtasks, and
bugs, or link tasks to product backlog items.
List types:
Flat list: A simple list of work items with a single Title column. No link
management is supported.
Tree list: A hierarchical list of work items that supports creating and updating tree
topology links, such as Parent-Child links, between work items. These lists include
two or more Title columns.
Parent-child links or other tree topology link types support creating a hierarchical
backlog structure. The work item types that participate in the hierarchy differ with
different processes and are shown in the following images.
Tree lists


# Page 1070

Hierarchies
The following image shows the hierarchy for the Agile process backlog work item:
User Stories and tasks are used to track work.
Bugs track code defects.
Epics and features are used to group work under larger scenarios.
Each team can configure how they manage Bug work items at the same level as
User Story or Task work items. Use the Working with bugs setting. For more
information about using these work item types, see Agile process.
To import a hierarchical list, see Add or import a hierarchical list of work items later in
this article.
You can open any query you defined in Azure Boards in Excel, including queries under
My Queries and Shared Queries. However, if you plan to share the workbook with other
team members, use a Shared Query. Other team members can't access workbooks or
worksheets based on personal queries stored under your My Queries folder.
You can use most Excel features when you work with a list of work items.
Features:
Format a cell or apply conditional formatting to a cell or column
Agile process
My queries versus shared queries
Use Excel features


# Page 1071

Cut and paste from one cell to other cells
Cut and paste a single row
Sum a column or add other formulas
Fill down cells
Filter
Add multiple worksheets to your workbook
Each worksheet in Excel can contain a different input list or query. However, all
worksheets within the workbook must connect to the same project within an
organization or project collection.
The following features behave differently when working with a worksheet connected to
Azure Boards.
Each cell or column of cells corresponds to a work item field. Each field is
associated with a data type. You can't enter data into an Excel cell that doesn't
meet the data type and requirements for that field.
You can only insert a single row at a time within the worksheet.
You can copy and paste multiple rows within the worksheet.
To move a work item within a hierarchy, cut the entire row and paste it under the
work item you want as its parent.
Use Outdent and Indent to change the location of a work item within the tree.
Undo (Ctrl Z) might not work. If you do something that you want to revert, you can
refresh the worksheet.
We recommend you publish and refresh your worksheet often to make sure your local
work remains in sync with Azure Boards data store. For more information about Excel,
see Basic Excel tasks
 .
You can sort work item flat lists using the Excel sort feature
. But, if you're working
from a tree list, you don't want to do any type of sort. Doing so changes the tree
structure and as such, the links between work items.
If you want to use Excel to manage the order of your work items as they appear in a
team backlog, you can do that by using the Stack Rank or Backlog Priority field (Agile or
Scrum process). You can set values in these fields, publish your worksheet, and refresh
your backlog. Your backlog items should appear reordered based on lowest to highest
number. However, the next time the backlog is reordered from the backlog, the values
you entered are subject to change.
Sort work items


# Page 1072

To maintain a specific order of work items, consider adding a custom field to manage
the sort order. You can then use this field within Excel to sort your flat list of work items.
This option doesn't change the order in which work items appear in your backlog.
You can and can't do the following tasks from an Excel worksheet:
Can do:
Add tags and bulk update work items with tags as described in Add work item tags
to categorize and filter lists and boards. Add the Tags field to your worksheet. Add
multiple tags separated by a semicolon (;).
Add simple text to a rich-text field, but if you're updating several work items in
bulk, you might lose formatting in existing work items.
Work offline and then reconnect and publish your changes. For more information,
see Connect Azure Boards to an Office client, Work offline, and reconnect.
Can't do:
Delete work items
Change the work item type of an existing work item
Move work items to another project
Import or update test case steps or other test artifacts
Add work items in any other State than the new State
Add to a work item discussion thread
Link to a remote work item.
1. Open Excel and connect to your Azure Boards project. Use one of the four
methods provided in Connect Azure DevOps project to Excel.
Tasks you can and can't do with Excel
Import work items as a flat list
７ Note
When you connect to Azure Boards in the cloud, the Team Project Collection
is automatically selected as there is only one collection associated with your
Azure DevOps Services organization. When you connect to Azure Boards in an
on-premises server, you choose the Team Project Collection prior to choosing
the project.


# Page 1073

2. In Excel, start with a blank worksheet. If you don't see the Team ribbon (or the
Team menu if you use Excel 2007), ensure that you installed the Azure DevOps
Office Integration 2019 tool
. For more information, see Azure DevOps Office
integration issues.
3. Choose New List from the Team ribbon.
4. From the New List dialog, choose Input list.
5. Your worksheet is now bound to your project as an input list (Query[None]), flat
list.
6. Specify the titles of the work items you want to add and their work item type.


# Page 1074

The State and Reason fields automatically populate with default values once your
select the work item type.
7. Publish your worksheet.
Make sure your cursor is in a cell that contains data. Otherwise, the Publish button
might appear disabled.
You work items now have ID numbers.
8. To assign values to other fields, open Choose Columns, add the fields, make the
assignments, and publish your changes.
 Tip
When you add work items to a team backlog, ensure you specify the team's
Area Path and Iteration Path. If you need to add Area Paths or Iteration Paths,


# Page 1075

9. To open a work item to add more information, Choose the work item you want to
open and then choose Open in Web Access. Before you do, make sure you publish
any changes you made.
A web browser opens and displays the work item. If you make changes to the work
item, immediately refresh your worksheet to capture the changes.
You can add a hierarchy of work items linked using parent-child links or other tree
topology link type.
1. Starting from Step 5 from the previous procedure, convert your flat list, input list
into a tree list. Choose a cell within the flat list and then select Add Tree Level.
select Edit Areas and Iterations. This link opens the Project settings page in a
web browser. For more information, see Define area paths and assign to a
team and Define Iteration Paths and configure team iterations.
Import work items as a tree list
） Important
Avoid sorting a tree list, as it can alter the hierarchical link relationships.


# Page 1076

If the Add Tree Level is disabled, you're working from a query list. To convert your
list to a tree list, you must first reconfigure your list to an input list.
2. Choose the link type to use when you're adding work items to a hierarchy, and
then select Convert. The most usual choice is Parent-Child. You can only select
from tree topology link types. For more information, see Link type topologies and
restrictions.
The List type changes to Tree and a second Title column appears.
3. To add more levels to the hierarchy, select Add Tree Level again. For example, if
you want to add a hierarchy of Epics, Features, and User Stories, you want to have
Title 1, Title 2, and Title 3 columns.
If you want to add tasks, add another tree level to have four title columns. To
remove a column, see Remove a tree level.
4. Save your Excel file.
5. Enter the Work Item Type and Titles for the hierarchy you want to import. The
State fields automatically fill in with default values once you select the work item
type.


# Page 1077

6. Publish your worksheet.
Make sure your cursor is in a cell that contains data. Otherwise, the Publish button
might appear disabled.
IDs are now assigned to your work items. In the background, the link type you
selected is used to link each work item in the hierarchy. Epics are linked to
Features. Features are linked to User Stories.
7. To check the links made, choose a work item and choose Links and Attachments.
For example, here we show the Child and Parent links created for a Feature that
was imported.


# Page 1078

8. To enter a row under a work item where you want to add a child, choose the row
and then choose Add Child.
9. To assign values to other fields, open Choose Columns, add the fields, make the
assignments, and publish your changes.
10. To change the hierarchy, cut and paste the entire row of a work item to place it
under the new parent. When you publish the change, the old hierarchical links are
deleted, and the new hierarchical links are created.
You can use the 
 or 
 indent/outdent icons to demote or promote a
work item within the tree hierarchy. Ensure the header at the top of the column reads
Title n; if it doesn't, add a tree level.
1. First, publish changes that you made to work items before you remove a tree level.
Removing a tree level requires a refresh, which overwrites data in the work item
list. You lose any data you didn't publish.
Remove a tree level


# Page 1079

2. Next, delete any content under the tree-level Title number column you want to
remove—the highest numbered column—. This column should be the highest
numbered column in the tree.
3. Refresh your worksheet. The column containing empty values for the Title is
removed.
You get an error message if you attempt to delete the column.
Excel uses the data in the Title columns to determine the pattern of links between work
items. When you publish changes, any of the following conditions can result in an error,
an invalid link, or a tree link being created between incorrect work items:
A row between the work items is blank within the hierarchy.
The title of a work item is in the wrong column. Ensure you enter a title for each
child work item.
Multiple Title columns contain data within a row. Enter text in only one of the title
columns per row.
The list was sorted. Avoid sorting a tree list, as it can change the hierarchical link
relationships. If you do sort a tree list, recover by immediately refreshing.
To resolve an error, see Resolve invalid links.
Additionally, a parent-child linked work item can only have one parent. You can't add
the same work item task to two backlog items. Instead, define distinct work item tasks.
The easiest way to bulk update multiple work items is to create a query for the work
items you want to update, and then open that query in Excel.
Tips for working with a tree list
Update work items in bulk with a query list
 Tip
Keep your work in sync with these tips:
Use 
 (Refresh) when you first open a saved worksheet to download the
latest data from the data store.
Add columns to the worksheet using 
 (Choose Columns) to enter data for
additional fields.


# Page 1080

1. From the web portal or Visual Studio, create the work item query that contains the
work items you want to update. For more information, see Create and save
managed queries with the query editor.
2. Open Excel and connect to your Azure Boards project. Use one of the four
methods provided in Connect Azure DevOps project to Excel.
3. If you opened your query from the web portal or Visual Studio, you're done. Make
any changes you want. Open Choose Columns, add fields, make assignments, and
publish your changes.
4. If you start from Excel, open a blank worksheet. You can add a worksheet to an
existing workbook, as long as you're choosing a query from the same project the
workbook is bound to.
5. Choose New List from the Team ribbon.
6. From the New List dialog, choose Query list, and select the query you want from
the drop-down menu.
Publish your additions and modifications often to avoid data conflicts.
Save your workbook periodically to prevent data loss before you publish or
refresh.


# Page 1081

The icon next to each query indicates the query type. The first two query types, Flat
list of work items and Work items and direct links are imported as flat list queries.
Only the Tree of work items queries import as a tree list.
7. With the work items imported to Excel, make the modifications you want and
publish your changes.
If you're working with a tree list, see also the information provided in Import a
hierarchical list of work items.
If the Tree group commands aren't available, your worksheet is configured as a flat or
query list. To enable the Tree group commands, convert the list to either an input list or
a list based on a tree query. For more information, see the next section on Change your
list type or query.
You can change the work items listed in your worksheet. Specifically, you can:
Change your flat list to a tree list
Change from a query list to an input list
Change from an input list to a query list
Enable Tree commands
Change your list type or query


# Page 1082

Change the query your worksheet references
You can change your flat list to a tree list. However, if your list is a query list, you need to
reconfigure it first. If the Tree group commands are disabled, it indicates a flat or query
list.
To convert your query list to an input list, follow these steps.
1. Publish your changes.
2. On the Team ribbon, choose Configure, List.
3. Choose Refresh work items only and then Apply.
This choice changes the query list to an input list.
4. To convert from an input list to a query list, choose Refresh from query, select the
query, and then Apply.


# Page 1083

If you're working from a query, modify your query to contain the work items you want.
Then refresh your list. The other work items appear in your list.
If you're working with an input list, complete these steps.
1. From the Team ribbon, choose Get Work Items.
2. Choose the method you want from the three options available.
Add existing work items to your worksheet


# Page 1084

If the work items are defined in another project, then first select the Project. Then,
make your selections:
Query. Use this method when you defined a query that contains the set or
superset of work items you want.
IDs. Use this method when you know the IDs of the work items that you want
to link to. In the IDs box, type the IDs of the work items that you want to find,
separated by commas or spaces.
Title contains. Use this method to find work items that have a common word
or phrase in the title field. In the and type list, select the type of work item
that you want to retrieve.
3. Choose Find.
Only those work items defined for the selected project and specified work item
type are listed. To sort on a column field, choose the column Title.
７ Note
To minimize the time required to run the query, narrow the filter criteria of the
search.


# Page 1085

4. In the list of returned work items, select the check-box of one or more work items.
Select each work item that should link to the current work item. You can also
press the SHIFT key while selecting to choose a range of work items, or press
the CTRL key while selecting to choose multiple work items.
Choose Select All to select all work items in the list.
If you start your worksheet with a New List, you see only a set of default field columns.
You can add columns using the Choose Columns on the Team ribbon.
If you start your worksheet from an existing query, you see all the column fields defined
for the query. From there, you can add columns using the Choose Columns. However,
your additions don't modify the underlying query.
1. To assign values to other fields, choose Column Options to add the fields of
interest.
To filter the fields based on work item type, select the Work item type.
To move or remove a field, choose the field and then select the > or < icons.
Add or remove column fields


# Page 1086

To change the field sequence, move the field up or down in the list using the
up and down arrows.
You can add a rich-text field, such as the Description field, however you
might lose some of the formatting upon publish.
2. Once the fields appear in the worksheet, assign values and publish your updates.
When working with identity fields, ones that accept user accounts, see the next
section, Select user accounts.
3. Save your worksheet.
Use the Select User feature to find user accounts and assign values to person-named
fields. This feature also provides access to the most recently used (MRU) values. If your
team has hundreds or thousands of user accounts, this feature is especially useful.
1. If you don't have the latest version of Visual Studio (2015.1 or later version
, get it
now. You need the latest update to access the Select User feature.
2. Choose an identity or person-named field to activate the Select User feature in the
Team ribbon.
An identity or person-named field contains a user identity. These fields are typically
synchronized with a user account database, such as Microsoft Entra ID, Active
Directory, or a Workgroup.
3. Begin entering the name of the user account and the Assign User dialog
automatically filters the results until you can select the account of interest.
Select user accounts
 Tip
Without the Select User feature, you must enter user names exactly as they are in
the database, or you'll receive data validation errors when you try to publish.


# Page 1087

Enter a letter to jump to names starting with that letter. Only user names are
recognized; account aliases aren't. As you select user names, Excel remembers your
recent selections, allowing you to choose user accounts directly from the field.
You can complete many actions from the Links tab of the Links and Attachments dialog.
Specifically, you can:
Review the existing links defined for the selected work item
Add links to selected work items to one or more work items or select objects
Delete links
Open a linked work item (opens in the web portal)
Edit the link type of an existing link
Add columns to the Link list and sort on that list
For more information on linking work items, see Link user stories, issues, bugs, and
other work items.
You can't use the Links and Attachments dialog to bulk update work item links. To bulk
update tree-topology link types, use a tree list instead.

For more information, see Create Excel reports from a work item query.
To resolve publishing errors that might arise when you're working in Excel, see one of
the following articles:
Resolve data conflicts: A data conflict occurs when a field value is changed in Azure
Boards since the last time you published from Excel.
Resolve data validation errors: A data validation error occurs if a field value violates
the rules for that field and work item type.
Resolve invalid links in a tree hierarchy: An invalid link happens when a work item
in a hierarchy or tree list and is moved or sorted, breaking the dependencies
between work items. To resolve this error, review the error message and reposition
the work items to restore the correct structure.
Address Error TF208104: Hierarchical Link Relationship Is Locked:
If you receive error TF208104, your changes to the fields are published, but
changes to the link hierarchy aren't. This error occurs because another process
locks at least one of the link relationships for the work item, such as Project Server
integration.
） Important
You can create an Excel report using New Report only from an on-premises Azure
DevOps Server. These reports require your project's collection to be configured to
support SQL Server Analytics Server.

Example query charts
Article • 11/27/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Query charts are excellent for visualizing status and trends. Adding multiple charts to a
dashboard allows quick monitoring of essential data for your team or project. Consider
discussing the following questions with your team:
Which query charts are most useful for us to create and monitor?
Which charts help maintain backlog hygiene?
What time frame should we use for trend charts?
While teams might have varied goals and tracking needs, Agile teams typically perform
these tasks. Select status and trend charts that support the following activities:
Triage incoming work to ensure new work is well defined
Plan sprints and set sprint goals as described in Scrum and best practices
Conduct daily stand-ups
Access levels: To create a query chart or view query charts from the Queries page,
have at least Basic access.
Permissions:
To create or edit a shared query, have your Contribute permission set to Allow
for the shared query folder.
To view a query chart added to a dashboard, have Read permissions to the
underlying query. If this permission is denied, then the widget displays a Widget
failed to load message.
Tasks: To add a query chart to a dashboard, save the query under the Shared
Queries folder.
Prerequisites
７ Note
Users with Stakeholder access for a public project have full access to query chart
features just like users with Basic access. Users with Stakeholder access for a
private project can't view or create charts from the Queries page, however, they can
view charts added to a team dashboard.


# Page 1096

For detailed instructions on creating query charts, see Track progress with status and
trend query-based charts. Ensure your queries adhere to the following guidelines:
Query type: Use Flat list of work items as only flat-list queries support query
charts.
Save changes: Save your query after modifying clauses or column options before
navigating to the Charts page.
Operators: Utilize In and Not In operators to include multiple work item types,
workflow states, or other groupings.
Trend charts: Limit queries for trend charts to a maximum of 1,000 work items to
avoid widget errors.
Grouping fields: Add relevant fields to your query clauses or column options. You
can group charts by:
State: Include the State field.
Assigned To: Include the Assigned To field.
Iteration Path: Include the Iteration Path field.
Node Name: Include the Node Name field for team grouping.
Custom Fields: Include any custom fields as needed.
Summing numeric columns: To sum a numeric column, include the corresponding
field in your query clause or column options. For examples, see Query by a numeric
field.
You can't group charts by the following field data types:
ID or Parent fields
Date-time fields (for example, Created Date, Changed Date)
Plain Text fields (for example, Title)
Rich-text fields (for example, Description, Acceptance Criteria, Repro Steps)
Tags: You can filter queries using tags, but can't use them to configure query
charts.
Guidelines for creating query charts
Limitations
７ Note
While you can't group a query-based chart by tags, you can group a Chart for
Work Items widget by tags added to a dashboard as described in Configure a
chart for work items widget.


# Page 1097

Create dashboard first: To add a query chart to a dashboard, first create the
dashboard. Then add the chart from the Queries > Charts page.
Refresh required: After you add a query, refresh your browser to register the new
query on the dashboard.
Optimize performance: For complex queries, see Best integration practices,
Optimize queries.
The following queries help your team maintain a healthy backlog by ensuring that work
is properly assigned. The following table provides example queries to review
periodically, typically at the beginning or end of a sprint. Customize these queries to fit
your team and organizational goals by replacing Fabrikam Team with your team name
and adding other filters as needed.
Query focus
Query clauses
Unassigned work: Work assigned to the current sprint but not assigned to a team
member.
Active work not assigned to the current sprint
Adding query charts to dashboards
Maintain backlog hygiene
７ Note
Work item types and workflow states applicable to your project might differ from
those shown in the following examples depending on the process used by your
project.


# Page 1098

Active work assigned to a past sprint
Stale work: Work items with no changes made in the last two to three months (query by
Changed Date).
Ill-defined work: For example, ones with no Description, Acceptance Criteria, Story
Points, or Effort defined.
In the following image, all five query charts appear on a team dashboard. To add query
charts to a dashboard, see Add charts to a dashboard


# Page 1099

Alternatively, you can add query tiles that reference the same query and show the total
count of work items as shown in the following image.
The following table provides some examples of status charts you can create and the
queries behind them.
Query focus
Query clauses
７ Note
The query tile widget is a 1x1 tile, whereas the smallest query chart dashboard
widget is 2x2. To add query tiles to a dashboard, see Add widgets to a dashboard.
Example status charts


# Page 1100

Planned work: How much work is represented in the backlog. A query that looks at work
in the New or Proposed category state provides a snapshot of work in the backlog.
Active bugs: Agile teams monitor their bug or technical debt and set goals to maintain
the total number under a specific number.
From this one query, you can create a chart based on assignment or state.


# Page 1101

Tagged work items: Monitor tagged work to ensure the team is meeting specific goals,
milestones, or categories of work.
Blocked work: How much work is currently blocked? You can query blocked work using
a tag or custom field.

Query by titles, IDs, and rich-text fields
Article • 11/27/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
When you want to find work items based on a keyword or phrase or a null text field, you
can do so by filtering on single-line text (String), multi-line text (PlainText), and rich-text
(HTML) fields. If you find that your queries take too long to return results, see Create a
query, Best practices.
Access levels:
To view and run shared queries, be a project member.
To add and save a shared query, have at least Basic access.
Permissions: Have your Contribute permission set to Allow for the folder that you
want to add a query to. By default, the Contributors group doesn't have this
permission.
Query clauses that specify a text or rich-text field can use the operators and macros
listed in the following table.
Data type
Supported operators and macros
Rich-text (HTML)
Multi-line text strings (PlainText)
Prerequisites
７ Note
Users with Stakeholder access for a public project have full access to query features
just like users with Basic access. For more information, see Stakeholder access
quick reference.
Supported operators and macros


# Page 1106

When you want to filter on a string match, try using the Contains Words  operator
instead of Contains . The Contains Words  operator runs a full-text search on the

７ Note
1. The Is Empty  and Is Not Empty  operators are supported for Azure DevOps
Server 2019 RC2 and later versions
2. The system automatically defaults to filtering based on the current project. For
more information, see Query across projects.
Use Contains words  for string matches


# Page 1107

specified field, which is faster in most cases. Text string is limited to 100 characters.
While the Contains  operator runs a table scan, which isn't only slower, but also
consumes more CPU cycles. These CPU cycles contribute towards your resource
consuming rate limit.
Use Contains or Contains Words to list items that partially or exactly match the words
or phrase that you enter.
７ Note
The Contains Words  operator makes use of SQL's full-text search indexing. When a
new value is saved to a long-text field, SQL Server will:
Split the phrase into individual words
Remove any common words that don't really add value to a search (like "a" or
"is" in English)
Convert words to their common stem (e.g. running, ran, and runner would get
converted into "run", as they are all variations on that word)
Store these unique keywords in an index.
When a user then runs a query on this field using the Contains Words  operator, the
search will be run against the unique keywords stored in the index. For long-text
fields, this makes searching much more efficient and quicker than doing a substring
search. By default, SQL defines a "word" as a set of characters between
punctuation. For example, periods signify the end of a word, but the period is not
considered to be part of the word. Because the full-text search index contains
keywords instead of exact phrases, you'll end up getting all the results that contain
the same keywords, as determined by the indexing.
Keyword or phrase query with wildcards


# Page 1108

Choose Contains or Does Not Contain to search against exact or partial matches of a
word or phrase. Choose Contains Words or Does Not Contain Words to search against
an exact phrase or to use the wildcard character, *. These operators use the full-text
search index.
For example, specify Contains Words and inform* to filter on a text field that contains
inform or information or informational.
Use Contains Words and Does Not Contain Words operators to list items that exactly
match the words or phrase that you enter, and exclude other words or phrases. You can
use these operators in combination and with the wildcard character (*).
In the following example, these operators filter work items for those items that contain
the work Phase but not the word Phasor.
 Tip
To understand how AND/OR  clauses are grouped, see Create and save managed
queries, Group clauses. To view the WIQL syntax for a query, install the WIQL
query editor extension
 which allows you to see the WIQL version of any query
editor entry.
Query for specific words and not others


# Page 1109

You can find work items that have an undefined field value by using the equals operator
=  and leaving the Value for the field blank. For example, the following filters list all work
items of type Task whose Activity field is blank.
To list work items based on a field that isn't blank, use the not operator <>  and leave the
Value blank.
You can find work items with empty Descriptions. Using the Is Empty or Is Not Empty
with an HTML field supports listing work items with empty or not empty rich text fields.
You don't specify a value with this operator.
For example, the following query filters list all work items with some Description field
entries.
７ Note
Certain reserved words in SQL, such as WHERE , THEN , and AND , do not return results
when used as standalone search terms with the Contains Words  or Does Not
Contain Words  filters.
Undefined field value queries
Empty or not empty HTML field queries


# Page 1110

To filter for a URL or a phrase that contains special characters like /  or - , use a
backslash to escape these characters. The following examples show how to filter for a
URL and for a phrase with a dash:
Filter for a URL: Search for a work item title that includes the phrase
https://example.com/path-to-resource .
Query: Title ~ "https:\/\/example.com\/path-to-resource"
Results: Returns all work items with the exact URL in the specified field.
Filter for a phrase with a dash: Search for a work item title that includes "your-
phrase-with-dash" .
Query: Title ~ "feature-update\-2023"
Results: Returns all work items that contain the exact phrase with dashes in the
specified field.
To filter work items based on the category they belong to, use the In Group operator.
For example, the following filter criteria return all work items that are in the current
project, assigned to the team member, and defined as belonging to the Bug Category.
Filter for special characters
７ Note
You can't query for work items that don't have any tags attached to them. To up
vote this feature request, do so on our Developer Community page, Be able to
search for empty tags
.
Category-based queries


# Page 1111

The default assignments of work item types to each category are listed as follows for
each process.
Process
Requirement category
Task category
Basic
Issue
Task
Agile
User Story
Task
Scrum
Product Backlog Item, Bug
Task
CMMI
Requirement
Task
Each team can determine if the Bug work item type appears in either the Requirement
or Task category. See Show bugs on backlogs and boards. You can add custom work
item types to a backlog. For more information, see Add or modify a work item type, Add
a custom WIT to a backlog or board.
You can use the @Follows macro to filter a list based on work items you're following
along with other query filters.
For example, the following query shows how to query across all projects for active work
items that you're following. You use the ID field and the In operator with the @Follows
macro.
What items appear in the Requirement or Task
categories?
ﾉ
Expand table
Query for work items that you're following


# Page 1112

You can use the following macros to list work items based on recent activity:
@MyRecentActivity: List items you recently viewed or modified.
@RecentMentions: List items you were added to via an @mention in the last 30
days.
@RecentProjectActivity: List items recently created or modified in your project.
Specify the ID field and either the In or Not In operators.
For example, the following query shows how to query for work items that you recently
viewed or modified.
The following table describes common fields used to filter queries. The ID fields
uniquely identify work items in a list. Use the Title field to distinguish the work item
from all others of the same type. The Description and other rich-text (data type=HTML)
fields provide additional information that is needed to implement work and track
changes. After a work item is created, you can modify all fields except for the ID. When

Query by assignment or workflow
changes
Article • 11/27/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Efficiently tracking assignment and workflow changes in your work items is essential for
maintaining project visibility and ensuring smooth progress. This article guides shows
how to create queries that monitor these changes, enabling better management and
oversight of your team's work.
Workflow states: Track the progress of work items as they move from New, Active,
or Proposed to Done or Closed. Each workflow includes:
States
Valid transitions
Reasons for transitions
Workflow states and reasons vary by work item type and project process.
State transitions and reassignments:
Work items can be reassigned during state transitions.
Example: A tester creates a bug and assigns it to a team member for triage.
Once resolved, the bug is reassigned back to the tester.
Identify work items that were closed but later reactivated by using the Changed Date
field. Focus on reactivations that occurred:
Today
Yesterday
In the last week
Track work status in workflows
Query reactivated work items


# Page 1118

You can also utilize the following fields:
Activated By
Activated Date
Other workflow-related fields
If you're new to creating queries, see Use the query editor to list and manage queries.
Access levels:
To view and run shared queries, be a project member.
To add and save a shared query, have at least Basic access.
Permissions: Have your Contribute permission set to Allow for the folder that you
want to add a query to. By default, the Contributors group doesn't have this
permission.
 Tip
Not all fields are valid for every work item type. Refer to Workflow and query fields
to see which fields are applicable to your queries and work item types.
Prerequisites
７ Note
Users with Stakeholder access for a public project have full access to query features
just like users with Basic access. For more information, see Stakeholder access
quick reference.
Supported operators and macros


# Page 1119

Query clauses that specify an identity or workflow-associated field can use the operators
and macros listed in the following table. To learn about the field data type, see Workflow
and board fields provided later in this article.

Use the In  and Not In  operators to filter for or exclude two or more pick list entries or
a delimited set of items. Use the In Group  or Not In Group  operators to filter for items
that belong or don't belong within a category group or security group. For more
information, see Query fields, operators, and macros.

The date and time pattern you enter for DateTime fields should match that which you
select through your profile. To view or change your selection, see Set user preferences.
 
Use the search box or query editor to quickly find work items based on an assignment
made to an Identity field. Also, you can filter for work items based on who changed,
resolved, or closed a work item. By specifying a time period, you can scope your query
even further, which can help with performance.
Use =  to find current assignments, Was Ever  to list items based on past assignments,
and @Me  to scope to your user identity.

To filter on items assigned to someone who belongs to a team or security group, use
the In Group operator.
You can use the In Group or Not In Group operators to filter a query based on several
values that are members of a group, or that aren't members of a group. Examples of
groups you can specify include the following items:
Teams
Built-in and custom security groups
Microsoft Entra ID and Active Directory security groups
Work item categories
Team or group membership queries


# Page 1122

You use the State, Reason, and Resolved Reason fields to query for items based on
workflow changes.
Filter for
Include these query clauses

And Closed Date > @Today-15
You can quickly find items that you changed, resolved, or closed. You can also find items
that were changed by other team members. Several fields—such as the Created By,
Changed By, Resolved By, and Closed By—are populated based on changes to the
workflow.

To list work items that changed state within a specific date range, you can use the State
Change Date field to narrow the search and then add clauses for changes to the State
field. An example is shown in the following image.
Using the query fields—Board Column, Board Column Done, and Board Lane—you can
list work items based on their flow status on the board. Additionally, you can create
status or trend charts from these queries.
You can filter items by team area path, specific custom columns, and swimlanes. If you
rename a column or swimlane, update the query filters accordingly. For more ideas, see

# Page 1125

The following fields are useful to filter queries. Some of these fields get updated as a
work item progresses from one state to another. Or they're updated as you move a work
item in the board to a different column or swimlane. Several of these fields don't appear
on the work item form, but they're tracked for those work item types listed in the
following table.
For more information about field attributes, see Work item fields and attributes.
Field name
Description
Work item type
Activated By 
The name of the team member who changed the status of a work item to an In Progress
category state.
Reference name= Microsoft.VSTS.Common.ActivatedBy
Data type=String (Identity)
Bug, Change Request, Epic, Feature, Issue, Product Backlog Item, Requirement, Review,
Risk, Shared Step, Task, Test Case, User Story
Activated Date 
The date and time when the work item was changed to an In Progress category state.
Reference name= Microsoft.VSTS.Common.ActivatedDate
Data type=DateTime
Work items that appear on more than one team's board can yield results that don't
meet your expectations because each team can customize its board columns and
swimlanes. The values assigned to Board Column, Board Column Done, and Board
Lane fields might differ from what you expect when another team updates the
work item from a different board. For more information, see Add, review, and
update work items in Azure Boards.

７ Note
1. See Date and Identity fields.
2. By default, the server synchronizes system-defined person-name or Identity-
based fields with Active Directory or Microsoft Entra ID. These fields include:
Activated By, Assigned To, Closed By, Created By, and Resolved By. You can
grant access to a project by adding security groups that you created in Active
Directory or Microsoft Entra ID or by adding accounts to existing or custom
groups defined from the collection setting Security page. See set up Active
Directory or Microsoft Entra ID.
3. See Activated By/Date and Resolved By/Date fields.
4. The Requirement Category applies to all work item types that appear on the
product backlog and board, and may include those added to the Bug
Category based on the team setting for Show bugs on boards and backlogs.
For more information on work item type categories, see Use categories to
group work item types.
７ Note
Even if you add a board-related field, such as Board Column or Board Lane, to a
work item form, you can't modify the field from the form.
People picker


# Page 1130

The Assigned To field is supported by the people picker feature. For example, when you
choose the Assigned To field from within a work item form, the people picker is
activated. As shown in the following image, you simply start entering the name of the
user you want to select, and search until you find a match. Users that you've previously
selected appear in the list automatically. To select users that you didn't previously select,
enter their entire name or search against the full directory.
@mention tool in Discussion showing people picker." />
For organizations that manage their users and groups using Microsoft Entra ID or Active
Directory, people pickers provide support for searching all users and groups added to
the AD, not just those users and groups added to the project.
To limit the scope of identities available for selection to just those users added to the
project, you can do so using the Project-Scoped Users group. For more information, see
Manage your organization, Limit identity search and selection.
Several date and identity fields are set based on workflow states or transitions. Some
fields, such as Created By and Created Date, are set by the system when a work item is
added. Other fields, such as Closed Date and Closed By, are set through the workflow
definition of the work item type. Additionally, customized work item types might have
other rules defined that influence the date and identity field assignments.
The date and time pattern you enter for DateTime fields should match that which you
select through your profile. To view or change your selection, see Set user preferences.
Date and identity fields
Date and time pattern


# Page 1131

 
The system updates these fields—Activated By, Activated Date, Resolved By, and
Resolved Date—when a change occurs based on corresponding workflow category
states. When the workflow state changes to an In Progress state category, Activated By
and Activated Date are updated. When the workflow state changes to a Resolved state
category, Resolved By and Resolved Date are updated.
To learn more how workflow states map to state categories, see How workflow states
and state categories are used in Backlogs and Boards.
Because these fields reference the workflow state categories, custom workflow states
that you add are referenced when updating the fields. To learn more about
customization, see Customize the workflow for a process.
Activated By/Date and Resolved By/Date fields
７ Note
The logic governing the fields described here applies to Azure DevOps Services,
Azure DevOps Server 2020.1 update, and later versions.
Additional notes:

The fields get updated anytime a work item moves from any category state other
than that being set. For example, if you update a work item from New to Fixed, the
Resolved By/Resolved Date fields are updated. However, if you update from Fixed
and Ready for Testing—which are in the same category state—the Resolved
By/Resolved Date fields aren't updated.
When you transition backwards, such as going from a Resolved to an Active state,
the system clears the values for Resolved By/Resolved Date fields. If you got from
Active to New, the system clears the values for Activated By/Activated Date fields.
Don't manually change the values for these fields. They are system fields that are
governed by system rules. Any value you attempt to set gets over written.

Query by area or iteration path
Article • 11/27/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
The Area Path and Iteration Path are two fields that appear on the work tracking form
for all work item types. You define them for a project—area paths and iteration paths—
and then select the ones you want to associate with a team.
To better understand how to work with area and iteration paths, see About teams and
Agile tools.
Access levels:
To view and run shared queries, be a project member.
To add and save a shared query, have at least Basic access.
Permissions: Have your Contribute permission set to Allow for the folder that you
want to add a query to. By default, the Contributors group doesn't have this
permission.
Prerequisites
７ Note
Users with Stakeholder access for a public project have full access to query features
just like users with Basic access. For more information, see Stakeholder access
quick reference.
７ Note
The following macros are only supported from the web portal: @CurrentIteration,
@CurrentIteration +/- n, @Follows, @MyRecentActivity, @RecentMentions,
@RecentProjectActivity, and @TeamAreas. Queries that contain these macros
won't work when opened in Visual Studio/Team Explorer, Microsoft Excel, or
Microsoft Project.
Supported operators and macros


# Page 1134

When creating queries and specifying the Area Path and Iteration Path fields, you can
use the following operators:
Operator
Use when you want to...
=
Specify one specific area or iteration path
<>
Filter out one, specific area or iteration path.
In
Filter for a set of area or iteration paths.
Not In
Exclude items that are assigned to a set of area or iteration paths.
Under
Specify all paths under a select area or iteration path.
Not Under
Exclude items assigned under a specific area or iteration path.
Along with these operators, you can use the following macros when you select the
Iteration Path. For examples, see Query by date or current iteration.
Macro
Use when you want to...
@CurrentIteration
Specify the current iteration associated with the selected team context.
@CurrentIteration +/-
n
Filter items based on assignment to a sliding window of sprints
associated with the selected team context.
@TeamAreas
Filter items based on area path(s) assigned to a specific team.
You can specify to filter for work items assigned to several area paths by using the In
operator as shown in the following example.

７ Note
The @CurrentIteration +/- n  and @TeamAreas  macros are supported for Azure
DevOps Server 2019 and later versions. These macros are only supported from the
web portal. Queries that contain these macros won't work when opened in Visual
Studio/Team Explorer, Microsoft Excel, or Microsoft Project.
Area path queries


# Page 1135

Use the Node Name field to filter on work items assigned to area paths based on a
keyword using the Contains operator. The Node Name specifies the last node of an
Area Path, which corresponds to the last node in the tree hierarchy.
The following query yields the same result as the previous example.
In this example, the filter returns any work items assigned to an area path whose last
node contains the word "Azure".
Here's another example that uses the Node Name and the In operator.
Node Name and keyword-based queries


# Page 1136

Use the @TeamAreas macro to quickly find items assigned to the area paths assigned to
a specific team. Specify the = operator. The Query Editor automatically prompts for you
to enter the name of the team. You can add it by entering the name of the team and
choosing the team value that appears in the search filter criteria.
Field name
Description
Reference name
Area Path
Groups work items into product feature or team areas. The
area must be a valid node in the project hierarchy.
System.AreaPath
Iteration
Path
Groups work items by named sprints or time periods. The
iteration must be a valid node in the project hierarchy.
System.IterationPath
For each field, data path= TreePath , reportable type= Dimension , index attribute= True .
If you define a path name that is longer than 256 characters, you can't specify it in
Microsoft Project. To avoid this problem, define path names of no more than 10
characters, and don't nest nodes more than 14 levels deep.
You can't apply most field rules to system fields, such as System.AreaPath and
System.IterationPath fields. For more information, see Rules and rule evaluation.
The following fields don't appear on work item forms but are tracked for each work item
type. These fields provide a numeric value for each classification value that is defined for
a project. You can use these fields to filter queries and create reports.

Query by date or current iteration
Article • 11/27/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
In this article, learn how to list work items based on when they were created, closed,
resolved, or changed. You can specify a date or use a supported macro. Use the @Today
macro and specify a plus or minus number of days for relative dates. For queries that list
work items based on their assignment to a team's current sprint, use @CurrentIteration .
For example, find work items that were modified in the last three days with the following
query.
Also, you can use the CurrentIteration +/- _n_  macro to create queries based on a
sliding window of team iterations.
Access levels:
To view and run shared queries, be a project member.
To add and save a shared query, have at least Basic access.
Permissions: Have your Contribute permission set to Allow for the folder that you
want to add a query to. By default, the Contributors group doesn't have this
permission.

You can use the @CurrentIteration  macro in a query from the following clients:
Web portal that connects to Azure Boards
Visual Studio 2019 or later versions connected to Azure Boards
The REST API
You can use the @CurrentIteration +/- n  macro in a query against Azure Boards, Azure
DevOps Server 2019, and later versions, and with a REST API that includes the team as a
parameter. An example is @CurrentIteration('[Project]\Team') .
An error occurs if you open a query that contains the @CurrentIteration  macro in earlier
versions of Visual Studio, or from Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Project. Also, you can't
use the macro when copying or cloning test suites and test cases, defining alerts, or with
REST APIs.

The query finds any item assigned to a sprint that corresponds to the current iteration
path for the team. For example, if a team is on Sprint 5, the query returns items assigned
to Sprint 5. Later, when the team is working in Sprint 6, the same query returns items
assigned to Sprint 6.
Azure Boards adds a team parameter when you select the @CurrentIteration or
@CurrentIteration +/- n macros. The team parameter derives from your current team
context.
To change the team parameter that the system automatically sets, choose it by entering
the name of the team in the parameter field added below the @CurrentIteration macro.
７ Note
For the @CurrentIteration  macro to work, the team must have selected an iteration
path whose date range encompasses the current date. For more information, see
Select team sprints and set the default iteration path. Also, queries that contain
this macro are only valid when run from the web portal.
See also Client restrictions on the use of the @CurrentIteration macros earlier in
this article.
 Tip
If the @CurrentIteration  macro isn't working, check that the expected iteration is
selected for your team and that dates have been set for it. For more information,
see Select team sprints.


# Page 1145

Use the @CurrentIteration +/- n  macro when you want to track the work a team
planned for upcoming sprints and for understanding work that wasn't completed in
previous sprints.
The following image shows how to list all User Story and Bug work item types that are
assigned to the sliding window. The window spans the last two, the current, and the next
two sprints selected for the Cloud Admin and Tools team.
Create a sliding window of your team's
iterations query
７ Note
For the @CurrentIteration +/- n  macro to work, the team must have selected
iteration paths that meet the +/- n  criteria. Date ranges must encompass the
current date for the @CurrentIteration . For more information about team selection
of iteration paths, see Select team sprints and set the default iteration path.
See also Client restrictions on the use of the @CurrentIteration macros earlier in
this article.


# Page 1146

To use this macro, the specified team must select a set of sprints that span the +/- n
value entered for the macro.
List work items that were defined for a sprint but later moved out by using a query with
a clause that contains the Was Ever  operator for the Iteration Path field. You can only
construct this query by using the WIQL syntax. Edit the WIQL syntax in Query Editor by
installing the WIQL Editor Marketplace extension
.
For example, the following syntax queries for work items meet the following criteria:
Defined in the current project.
Work item type equals User Story or Bug.
Work items are under the Fabrikam Fiber Web team Area Path.
Work items aren't in a Closed , Completed , Cut , or Resolved  state.
Not in the current iteration path for the Fabrikam Fiber Web team.
Were assigned to the current iteration path for the Fabrikam Fiber Web team.
Are now assigned to the current iteration +1 for the Fabrikam Fiber Web team.
Were changed within the last 30 days (the length of the sprint).
WIQL
List work items moved out of a sprint
SELECT
    [System.Id],
    [System.WorkItemType],
    [System.AssignedTo],


# Page 1147

The Query Editor view of the syntax appears as shown.
    [System.Title],
    [System.State],
    [System.Tags],
    [System.IterationPath],
    [System.AreaPath]
FROM workitems
WHERE
    [System.TeamProject] = @project
    AND [System.WorkItemType] IN ('User Story', 'Bug')
    AND [System.AreaPath] UNDER 'FabrikamFiber\Web'
    AND NOT [System.State] IN ('Completed', 'Closed', 'Cut', 'Resolved')
    AND NOT [System.IterationPath] = @currentIteration('[FabrikamFiber]\Web 
<id:cdf5e823-1179-4503-9fb1-a45e2c1bc6d4>')
    AND (
        EVER (
            [System.IterationPath] = @currentIteration('[FabrikamFiber]\Web 
<id:cdf5e823-1179-4503-9fb1-a45e2c1bc6d4>')
        )
        AND [System.IterationPath] = @currentIteration('[FabrikamFiber]\Web 
<id:cdf5e823-1179-4503-9fb1-a45e2c1bc6d4>') + 1
        AND [System.ChangedDate] >= @today - 30
    )
ORDER BY [System.Id]
７ Note
The Query Editor displays a 
 information icon next to the Was Ever  operator,
indicating an issue with the clause. However, the query still runs and you can create
query charts. To modify the query, you must use the WIQL Editor
.


# Page 1148

To list newly created work items added to a sprint after its start date, use a query similar
to the one shown in the following image. This query works by filtering for work items
assigned to the current sprint but were created after the start of the sprint date. Use the
clause created Date = @Today - 28 .
For other options for querying changes to sprint scope, see Sprint scope change.
Use Date fields to filter your queries. Some of these fields are populated with
information as a work item progresses from one state to another. Several of these fields
don't appear on the work item form, but they're tracked for those work item types listed
in the following table.

Add work item tags to categorize and
filter lists and boards
Article • 11/27/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Tag work items to quickly filter the product backlog or a work item query by categories
that you define. A tag corresponds to a one or two keyword phrase that you define and
that supports your needs to filter a backlog or query, or define a query.
Tags are a better choice for filtering work items than using text strings as described in
Define a query/Best practices.
You can add and modify tags from the web portal, from Team Explorer plug-in for Visual
Studio. Also, you can open a query in Excel to modify tags in bulk.
Permissions:
To view, follow, and edit work items, have View work items in this node and
Edit work items in this node permissions set to Allow. By default, the
Contributors group has these permissions. For more information, see Set work
tracking permissions.
To add tags to work items, have the project-level Create new tag definition
permission set to Allow. By default, the Contributors group has this permission.
Access levels:
Be a project member.
To add new tags to work items or to view or follow pull requests, have at least
Basic access.
To view or follow work items, have at least Stakeholder access. For more
information, see About access levels.
All project members, including those in the Readers group, can send emails
containing work items.
７ Note
Tags are a shared resource associated with a project and not a team. If your project
contains multiple teams, all teams add to and work from the same set of tags.
Prerequisites


# Page 1154

By default, all Contributors and Stakeholders in public projects can add
new and existing tags. In private projects, Stakeholders can only add
existing tags. To control the ability to create new tags, set the Create tag
definition permission at the project level. For more information, see Change
project-level permissions.
Tags should be 400 characters or less and not contain separators such as a ,  (comma),
;  (semicolon), or other formatting character.
Recommendation: Don't use the @  character in a tag. Tags that start with the @
character can't be used in a work item query. The @  character signifies a macro within a
query and therefore the tag isn't recognized as a tag.
From the web portal, open a work item and add a tag. Choose Add tag and type your
keyword. Or, select from the list of previously assigned tags.
To add several tags at one time, type a comma between tags. Tags are case sensitive.
Tags that appear in the tag bar are already assigned to the work item. To unassign a tag,
choose the x on the tag,
.
７ Note
Provide Stakeholder access to members who want to contribute to the
discussion and review progress. These are typically members who don't
contribute to code, but want to view work items, backlogs, boards, and
dashboards.
Add tags to a work item
Bulk add or remove tags


# Page 1155

You can bulk update work items to add or remove tags from the web portal. You bulk
modify tags in the same way as you bulk modify other fields using the web portal. Or,
you can use Excel to bulk add or remove tags.
To query work items based on tags, add a clause for each tag you want to use to
support your query.
You can use the Contains or Does Not Contain operators. Tags that start with the @
character can't be used in a work item query as the query editor interprets the @
７ Note
Bulk modifying tags from Visual Studio or other supported clients isn't supported.
Query for work items based on tags
 Tip
To understand how AND/OR  clauses are grouped, see Create and save managed

 to select it from the
menu of options.
７ Note
You can't query for work items that don't have any tags attached to them. If you'd
like to up vote the request to support this feature, you can do so on our Developer
Community page, Be able to search for empty tags

From the web portal, you can filter backlogs, boards, and query results using tags.
Begin by choosing Filter 
 .
Check the boxes of those tags that you want to filter on. Keep the OR selection to run a
logical OR for all the tags you selected. Or, choose the AND option to run a logical AND
on all the selected tags.
Filter lists using tags


# Page 1159

You can't delete tags using the Azure DevOps Web UI.
If you need to remove a tag, you can create a script or application capable of a delete
using the Azure DevOps REST API or the .NET client libraries. For more examples, see
Azure-DevOps-Admin-CLI
.
Another option is to install the Marketplace Tags Manager
, which adds a Tags page
under Boards or Work to manage tags, including deletes.
Highlight tags on board cards by color-coding them. These colors only appear on the
board that you configure. They don't appear on backlogs or Taskboards. For more
information, see Customize cards, color-code tags.

You can't group a query-based chart by tags, but, you can group a Chart for Work Items
widget by tags that you add to a dashboard. This feature is in public preview. To enable
it, see Manage or enable features and turn on Enable group by tags for work item
chart widget on dashboard.
To group a Chart for Work Items widget by tags, complete the same steps provided in
Track progress with status and trend query-based charts, Add a chart widget to a
dashboard. Make sure that your flat-list query contains Tags in the query clause or as a
column option. Then, choose Tags for the Group by selection. To filter the chart to show
only some tags, choose the Selected tags radio button and then choose the tags you
want the chart to display.

While no hard limit exists, creating more than 100,000 tags for a project collection can
negatively affect performance. Also, the autocomplete dropdown menu for the tag
control displays a maximum of 200 tags. When more than 200 tags are defined, begin
entering to cause the tag control to display relevant tags.
You can't assign more than 100 tags to a work item or you receive the following
message:
Save the work item with the tags (100 or less) that you added, and then you can add
more tags.
Limit queries to fewer than 25 tags. More than that amount and the query likely times
out.

Query work item history and discussion
fields
Article • 11/27/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
The history of a work item records who created the item, what changes were made, and
the reasons behind those changes. This information is essential for tracking the
evolution of an item over time. When adding entries to the history field, include detailed
information to help the next work item owner understand the context of the changes
and the actions required.
Access levels:
To view and run shared queries, be a project member.
To add and save a shared query, have at least Basic access.
Permissions: Have your Contribute permission set to Allow for the folder that you
want to add a query to. By default, the Contributors group doesn't have this
permission.
Supported operators:
Contains Words
７ Note
There is no separate Discussion work item field. To query work items with
comments from the Discussion area, filter on the History field. All text entered into
the Discussion box is automatically included in the History field.
Prerequisites

Query by field value comparisons
Article • 11/27/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
You can create queries based on how one field's value compares to another using the
comparison field operators. This query is useful to filter work items based on:
Is the person who created the work item the same as or different than the person
assigned to it? Or, who closed it
Which Tasks were closed before or after their Target Date.
Access levels:
To view and run shared queries, be a project member.
To add and save a shared query, have at least Basic access.
Permissions: Have your Contribute permission set to Allow for the folder that you
want to add a query to. By default, the Contributors group doesn't have this
permission.
You can use the comparison field operators— =[Field], <>[Field], >[Field], <[Field],
>=[Field], <=[Field] —with the following field data types. The data type you select for
the Field and the Value must match.
Boolean (supports =[Field], <>[Field]
Date/Time
Double, Integer
GUID
Identity
String (excluding Tags)

Query by numeric fields
Article • 11/27/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Learn how to query by numeric fields based on effort, schedule, story points, or time
tracking fields in Azure Boards and Azure DevOps.
The most common numeric fields track effort for items in the Requirements category or
estimated, remaining, and completed work for items in the Task category. With queries
you can list the work items of interest, and then define a chart that shows either a count
of work items or a sum of a numeric field.
Access levels:
To view and run shared queries, be a project member.
To add and save a shared query, have at least Basic access.
Permissions: Have your Contribute permission set to Allow for the folder that you
want to add a query to. By default, the Contributors group doesn't have this
permission.
Supported query clauses that specify a numeric field can use the following operators.
=  , <>  , >  , <  , >=  , <=
=[Field] , <>[Field] , >[Field] , <[Field] , >=[Field] , <=[Field]
In , Not In

Prerequisites
７ Note
Users with Stakeholder access for a public project have full access to query features
just like users with Basic access. For more information, see Stakeholder access
quick reference.
Use operators and macros
Develop chart-based queries


# Page 1181

The following tips can help you develop your queries:
Add charts for flat-list queries only.
Reference either query filters or fields displayed through column options.
Save changes you make to your query before you add or modify a chart.
Group one or more clauses by selecting them and then the 
 group clauses icon.
To ungroup, select on the grouped clause.
For more information, see Use the query editor to list and manage queries and Charts
and Add or modify a field.
The following table shows useful filters for queries.
Filter for
Include these query clauses
User stories or bugs
Work Item Type In User Story,Bug
Tasks or bugs
Work Item Type In Task,Bug
Items that are Active or Closed
State In Active,Closed
Items in the Requirements category
Work Item Type In Group Microsoft.RequirementCategory
Unestimated user stories
Story Points <> (leave Value field blank)
Use filters
Query for count of work items


# Page 1182

All queries show a count of items when you run the query. Here we define a flat-list
query that filters for bugs in any state.
Also, all charts contain a Values selection designed to display a count of work items
within the chart.
To show Assigned To and State, create an active bugs query and modify the column
options. Then, add a pivot chart that displays the assignments and state.
Query for count of bugs per developer


# Page 1183

Using the same flat-list query that filters for bugs shown in the previous section, you can
show a count based on area. Modify the column options to show the Area Path. Then,
add a pivot chart that displays the state and area path.
Query for count of bugs by state and area


# Page 1184

You can find work items that have an undefined field value by using the equals operator,
= , and leaving the Value for the field blank. For example, the following filters list all work
items of type User Stories whose Story Points field is blank.
To list work items based on a field that isn't blank, use the not operator, <> , and leave
the Value blank.
Query for undefined field values
Query for effort or story points


# Page 1185

You can assign Story Points to user stories or bugs when you work in an Agile process.
Or, Effort to product backlog items and bugs when you work in a Scrum process. For
more information, see Basic, Agile, Scrum, or CMMI work item types and workflow
articles.
Create a query that filters for User Story as the work item type and modify the column
options to show Story Points and State.
Then, add a stacked bar chart that sums the Story Points.
Query for sum of story points and their status


# Page 1186

For more information on system-defined cumulative flow diagrams, see Cumulative
flow.
Create a query that filters for User Story as the work item type and in the Active or
Closed state. To show Story Points, modify the column options.
Then, add a stacked area trend chart that sums the Story Points.
Query for burn up chart of user stories for an iteration
Query for remaining and completed work


# Page 1187

Based on the process your project references, you can assign the following fields to
tasks or bugs.
Process
Available fields
Agile
Original Estimate, Remaining Work, Completed Work
Scrum
Remaining Work
CMMI
Original Estimate, Remaining Work, Completed Work
If you follow Scrum practices and estimate Remaining Work for your tasks and bugs, you
can get a rollup of remaining work with the following query and chart. Use the In
operator and include both Task and Bug to include any bugs that are tracked as tasks.
Add Remaining Work as a column option to the query and save. To view a sum of the
remaining work, add a pivot chart as shown in the following example.

2. The values displayed in the Capacity page for Activity (Agile or Scrum) or
Discipline (CMMI) reflect a union of all values defined for the field in all
projects within the project collection instance. Therefore, to restrict the values
that appear for Capacity on the sprint backlog pages, you must make the
values match in all the projects for the field assigned to type="Activity" .
3. To change the ProcessConfiguration field assignment (on-premises only), see
Process configuration XML element reference.
4. Each team can configure their Agile tools to determine if bugs are treated
similar to requirements or tasks. Since bugs can appear either with
requirements or tasks, fields used to estimate effort at the requirement-level
and the task-level are included in the work item form.

1. To change the menu selection, see Add and manage fields (Inherited process) or
Add or modify a field, customize a picklist (On-premises XML process).
2. The sequence of items on a product backlog page is determined according to
where you added or dragged the items. As you drag items, a background process
updates either the Backlog Priority (Scrum) or Stack Rank (Agile, Basic, CMMI) field.
These fields determine the order in which backlog items appear on a backlog
page. They're assigned to type="Order"  in the ProcessConfiguration file.
The Backlog Priority and Stack Rank fields don't appear on the work item forms. (To
learn why, see Where is the field on the work item form to order the backlog?
.
To add the field to the form:
For an Inherited process, add the Stack Rank field to a work item type (for the
custom process that your project references).
For an On-premises XML process, add the field to the form, modify the WIT XML
definition to add the following control element:

Create a query based on build and test
integration fields
Article • 11/27/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Work item fields that support build and test integration offer powerful functionalities to
enhance your development workflow. These integrations enable the following key
actions:
Associate bugs with builds: Link bugs directly to the specific builds where they
were discovered or resolved, ensuring precise tracking and accountability.
Query bugs by build: Retrieve and analyze bugs associated with particular builds
to identify trends and areas needing improvement.
Mark test cases as Manual or Automated: Categorize test cases accordingly and
store relevant information to support automated testing processes.
Define action and validation steps for test cases and shared steps: Specify the
actions to perform, validation criteria, and the data required to execute tests
effectively.
This article provides guidance on how to use build and test integrations to improve your
project's quality and efficiency.
Project-level permissions:
Contributors: Can create and edit queries.
Readers: Can view queries but can't create or edit them.
Project Administrators: Have full control over all project settings, including
queries.
Specific permissions for Test Artifacts:

Team Foundation Build is the on-premises build system you can use with Azure DevOps
Server. You can configure your build process by using Team Foundation Build, and Team
Foundation Build can generate work items when a build fails. It can also add build
information to work items that were resolved in a particular build. Team Foundation
Build requires that the following two fields get added to the work item type definition:
Found In and Integration Build.
Found In and Integrated in Build fields are defined for Bugs in the default processes.
These fields associate bugs with the builds where they were found or fixed.
You can use the following code snippet to add these fields to a WIT definition.
1
７ Note
1. Do not customize the pick list for these fields. The system accepts only those
values listed.
Fields that integrate with Team Foundation Build
<FIELD name="Found In" refname="Microsoft.VSTS.Build.FoundIn" type="String" 
reportable="dimension">
    <HELPTEXT>Product build number (revision) in which this item was 
found</HELPTEXT>
        <SUGGESTEDVALUES>
          <LISTITEM value="&lt;None&gt;" />
        </SUGGESTEDVALUES>
</FIELD>
<FIELD name="Integration Build" 
refname="Microsoft.VSTS.Build.IntegrationBuild" type="String" 
reportable="dimension">


# Page 1217

When the Found In field is present in a WIT definition, Team Foundation Build creates a
work item when a build fails, and sets the Found In field to the build number of the
build that failed. If the Found In field is missing, Team Foundation Build doesn't create a
work item for the failed build, and everything else works as expected.
When the Integration Build field is present in the WIT definition, Team Foundation Build
identifies work items that were resolved with each build and then updates those work
items to set the build number in which they were resolved in the Integration Build field.
If the Integration Build field is missing, Team Foundation Build doesn't store the build
number in the work items, and everything else works as expected.
The first time you queue a build for a project using Team Foundation Build, it
automatically adds a global list labeled Build - ProjectName. Each time a build is run, a
LISTITEM is added to this global list with the name of the build.
With Test Plans, you can automate the creation of a bug or other type of work item
when a test fails. For more information, see Add findings to existing bugs with
exploratory testing.
When you create a work item in this manner, information about the system and the
steps to reproduce the bug gets captured in the System Info and Repro Steps fields.
Associating and resolving work items with TFVC
Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) offers a feature that allows you to associate or
resolve work items directly during the code check-in process. When you work on a
specific work item and make corresponding code changes, you can link that work item
from within the source-control check-in window upon completing your changes.
How TFVC resolves work items
    <HELPTEXT>Product build number this bug was fixed in</HELPTEXT>
        <SUGGESTEDVALUES>
          <LISTITEM value="&lt;None&gt;" />
        </SUGGESTEDVALUES>
</FIELD>
Builds and global list autopopulation
Fields that Integrate with Test Plans
Fields that integrate with Team Foundation Version
Control


# Page 1218

The ability of TFVC to resolve a work item depends on the presence of a specific action
within the work item. Here's how the process works:
1. Action verification: The source control system queries the work item tracking
system to determine if the work item supports the required action.
2. State transition: If the action is supported, TFVC retrieves the source and
destination states associated with the transition.
3. Work item update: Upon checking in the code, TFVC transitions the work item's
state according to the predefined transition.
This integration ensures that work items accurately reflect the status of associated code
changes, enhancing traceability and accountability within your development workflow.
For more information, see Automate field assignments based on State, Transition, or
Reason.
There are the following limitations when querying by test case:
Hierarchical views: You can’t construct a query that shows a hierarchical view of
Test Plans, Test Suites, and Test Cases. These items aren’t linked together using
parent-child link types.
Query-based test suites: While you can create query-based test suites, the suite
automatically includes every test case that gets returned by the query you define,
which can sometimes lead to unintended test cases being included if the query
isn’t precise.
Field limitations: Some fields related to test cases, such as detailed execution
results, might require creative usage of existing fields or customization of payload
data to be fully utilized.
Performance and rate limits: Azure DevOps imposes limits on the resources
individuals can consume and the number of requests they can make.
Nonoptimized queries or excessive API calls can lead to delays or blocked
requests.
Test case linking: Test cases aren’t automatically linked to other work items in a
way that supports complex queries. For example, you can’t easily query for a

When you use the Checkin action, you must set appropriate from and to states to
reflect the state transition that you want.

It's possible to construct a query using WIQL syntax that uses an operator, such as
Was Ever, for other data type fields than those listed. For example, you can use Was
Ever within a clause using the Iteration Path. For an example, see Query by date or
current iteration, List work items moved out of a sprint.
Query macros or variables


# Page 1229

Macro
Description
[Any]
Use with the Work Item Type or State fields to search across all work item types or
across all states. For example, Work Item Type=[Any]  doesn't place any filters based on
the work item type.
@CurrentIteration
Use with the Iteration Path field to automatically filter for work items assigned to the
current sprint based on the current team focus or context. For specific examples, see
Query by date or current iteration.
The @CurrentIteration macro only works when run from the web portal. You can't use
the macro when copying or cloning test suites and test cases, defining alerts, or with
REST APIs.
@CurrentIteration +/- n
Use with the Iteration Path field to filter the set of work items assigned to the current
sprint +/- n sprints based on the current team focus or context. For specific examples,
see Query by date or current iteration.
The @CurrentIteration +/- n macro is supported for Azure Boards, Azure DevOps Server
when run from the web portal.
７ Note
The following macros are only supported from the web portal: @CurrentIteration,
@CurrentIteration +/- n, @Follows, @MyRecentActivity, @RecentMentions,
@RecentProjectActivity, and @TeamAreas. Queries that contain these macros
won't work when opened in Visual Studio/Team Explorer, Microsoft Excel, or
Microsoft Project.


# Page 1230

@Follows
Use with the ID field and In operator to list all work items that you're following in the
project. For more information, see Follow a work item or pull request. You can view this
same list from the Work Items page, Following pivot view.
The @Follows macro is supported only when run from the web portal.
@Me
Use with an identity or user account field to automatically search for items associated
with your user or account name. For example, you can find work items that you opened
with the clause Created By=@Me . For more examples, see Query by assignment, workflow,
or board changes.
@MyRecentActivity
Use with the ID field and In operator to list work items you viewed or updated in the
project within the last 30 days. You can view this same list from the Work Items page,
My activity pivot view.
@Project
Use with the Team Project field to filter for work items in other projects. For example,
you can find all the work items in the currently selected project with the clause Team
Project=@Project . The system automatically defaults to filtering based on the current
project. For more information, see Define a query, Query across projects.
@RecentMentions
Use with the ID field and In operator to list work items where you're mentioned in the
Discussion section. You can view this same list from the Work Items page, Mentioned
pivot view.
@RecentProjectActivity


# Page 1231

Use with the ID field and In operator to list work items recently updated. The number of
work items listed depends on the work tracking activity of the project. For highly active
projects, the macro lists work items updated in the project within the last 30 days or so.
For less active projects, however, this list could include work items older than 30 days.
You can view similar lists from the Work Items page, Recently created, Recently
updated and Recently completed pivot views. The number of work items returned is
capped at 5000.
@StartOfDay
Use with a DateTime  field to filter for work items that relate to the current date or with a
plus/minus offset. For example, you can find all items closed in the last week with the
clause Closed Date&gt;=@StartOfDay-7 . For more examples, see Query by date or current
iteration.
@StartOfMonth
Use with a DateTime  field to filter for work items that relate to the current month or with
a plus/minus offset. For example, you can find all items created in the last three months
with the clause Created Date&gt;=@StartOfMonth-3 . For more examples, see Query by
date or current iteration.
@StartOfWeek
Use with a DateTime  field to filter for work items that relate to the current week or with a
plus/minus offset. For example, you can find all items changed in the last two weeks
with the clause Changed Date&gt;=@StartOfWeek-2 . For more examples, see Query by
date or current iteration.
@StartOfYear
Use with a DateTime  field to filter for work items that relate to the current year or with a
plus/minus offset. For example, you can find all features that have a Target Date
scheduled within the current year with the clause Target Date&gt;=@StartOfYear . For
more examples, see Query by date or current iteration.


# Page 1232

@TeamAreas
Only use with the Area Path field to filter for work items whose area path corresponds
to one assigned to a specific team. Requires you use the = operator. For example, you
can find all items assigned to the area paths assigned to the Web team with the clause
Area Path=@TeamAreas [Fabrikam Fiber]\Web . For more examples, see Query by area or
iteration path.
The @TeamAreas macro is supported for Azure DevOps Server only when run from the
web portal.
@Today
Use with a DateTime  field to filter for work items that relate to the current date or to an
earlier date. You can also modify the @Today macro by subtracting days. For example,
you can find all items created in the last week with the clause Created Date&gt;=@Today-
7 . For more examples, see Query by date or current iteration.
Specify Contains or Does Not Contain to search against exact or partial matches of a
word or phrase. These operators filter items based on the full-text search index created
for long-text fields. Specify Contains Words or Does Not Contain Words to search
against an exact phrase or to use the wildcard character, *. These operators use the full-
text search index. You can only use the wildcard character at the end of a partial word or
phrase.
For examples, see Example work item queries and Query for work items using the
History field.
Full-text and partial word searches
７ Note
Not all deployments support full-text searches. For example, SQL Express and SQL
Azure, which support the cloud service, do not support full-text search. In these
instances, you only see the Contains and Does not Contain operators.

Work Item Query Language (WIQL)
syntax reference
Article • 03/25/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
You can use the WIQL syntax to define a query as a hyperlink or when using the Work
Item Query Language (REST API).
The WIQL syntax supports all functions available through the web portal Query Editor
plus a few more. You can specify the fields to return and specify logical grouping of
query clauses. In addition, you can use an ASOF  clause to filter based on assignments
based on a previous date.
A query returns only those work items for which you have the View work items or View
work items in this node permission. Typically, these permissions are granted to
members of the Readers and Contributors groups for each team project. For more
information, see Permissions and groups.
The work item query language has five parts shown in the following syntax snippet and
described in the following table. WIQL syntax isn't case-sensitive.
WIQL
） Important
The WIQL syntax is used to execute the Query By Wiql REST API. Currently, there is
no way to call the API to return the detailed work item information from a WIQL
query directly. No matter which fields you include in the SELECT statement, the API
only returns the work item IDs. To get the full information, you need to perform two
steps: (1) get the ID of the work items from a WIQL, and (2) get the work items via
Get a list of work items by ID and for specific fields.
Prerequisites
Query language overview
SELECT
    [System.Id],


# Page 1235

Clause
Example
SELECT
Identifies the fields to return for each work item returned by the query. You can specify
either the friendly name or reference name. Use square brackets ([]) if the name contains
blanks or periods.
FROM
Indicates whether you want the query to find work items or links between work items.
Use FROM WorkItems  to return work items.
Use FROM workItemLinks  to return links between work items. For more information,
see Queries for links between work items later in this article.
WHERE
Specifies the filter criteria for the query. For more information, see Filter conditions
(WHERE) later in this article.
ORDER BY
    [System.AssignedTo],
    [System.State],
    [System.Title],
    [System.Tags]
FROM workitems
WHERE
    [System.TeamProject] = 'Design Agile'
    AND [System.WorkItemType] = 'User Story'
    AND [System.State] = 'Active'
ORDER BY [System.ChangedDate] DESC
ASOF '02-11-2020'
 Tip
By installing the Wiql Editor Marketplace extension
, you can construct your
queries using the Query Editor and then view the WIQL syntax. You can then copy
and modify the WIQL syntax and run the query using the Wiql Playground hub
added to Boards.


# Page 1236

Specifies the sort order of the work items returned. You can specify Ascending (Asc) or
Descending (Desc) for one or more fields. For example:
ORDER BY [State] Asc, [Changed Date] Desc
ASOF
Specifies a historical query by indicating a date for when the filter is to be applied. For
example, this query returns all user stories that were defined as Active on February 11,
2020. Specify the date according to the guidance provided in Date and time pattern.
ASOF '02-11-2020'
The date and time pattern you enter for DateTime fields should match that which you
select through your profile. To view or change your selection, see Set user preferences,
Time and Locale.
７ Note
The WIQL length of queries made against Azure Boards must not exceed 32K
characters. The system won't allow you to create or run queries that exceed that
length.
Date and time pattern


# Page 1237

 
Quote (single or double quotes are supported) DateTime literals used in comparisons.
They must be in the .NET DateTime format of the local client computer running the
query. Unless a time zone is specified, DateTime literals are in the time zone of the local
computer.
WIQL
When the time is omitted in a DateTime literal and the dayPrecision parameter equals
false, the time is assumed to be zero (midnight). The default setting for the dayPrecision
parameter is false.
Or, you can specify ISO 8601 format which is valid no matter the locale. ISO 8601
represents date and time by starting with the year, followed by the month, the day, the
hour, the minutes, seconds and milliseconds. For example, 2021-12-10 15:00:00.000,
represents the 10th of December 2021 at 3 p.m. in local time. An example of using ISO
8601 format is as follows.
WIQL
WHERE 
   AND [System.ChangedDate] >= '01-18-2019 GMT'
   AND ([Closed Date] < '01-09-2022 GMT'
   OR [Resolved Date] >= '01-18-2019 14:30:01')  


# Page 1238

You can add a custom field to a query clause. With WIQL, you must specify the reference
name for the custom field. For projects that use an Inherited process model, custom
fields are typically labeled with Custom. prepended to their name, and spaces removed.
For example:
Friendly name
Reference name
Approver
Custom.Approver
Request Type
Custom.RequestType
Scope Estimate
Custom.CustomEstimate
For projects that use the On-premises XML process model, the reference name is as
defined by the XML work item type definitions.
For more information, see Work item fields and attributes.
The WHERE  clause specifies the filter criteria. The query returns only work items that
satisfy the specified criteria. For example, the following example WHERE  clause returns
user stories that are active and that are assigned to you.
WIQL
You can control the order in which logical operators are evaluated by enclosing them
within parentheses to group the filter criteria. For example, to return work items that are
either assigned to you or that you closed, change the query filter to match the following
example.
WHERE 
   AND [System.ChangedDate] >= '2019-01-18T00:00:00.0000000'
   AND ([Closed Date] < '2022-01-09T00:00:00.0000000'
   OR [Resolved Date] >= '2019-01-18T00:00:00.0000000')

Specify filter clauses ( WHERE )
WHERE [Work Item Type] = 'User Story'
   AND [State] = 'Active'
   AND [Assigned to] = @Me


# Page 1239

WIQL
Each filter condition is composed of three parts, each of which must conform to the
following rules:
Field: You can specify either the reference name or friendly name. The following
examples are valid WIQL syntax:
Reference name: SELECT [System.AssignedTo] ...
Friendly name with spaces: SELECT [Assigned To] ...
Names without spaces don't require square brackets: SELECT ID, Title ...
Operator: Valid values are specified in the Operators section later in this article.
Field value: You can specify one of the following three values depending on the
field specified.
A literal value must match the data type of the field value.
A *variable or macro that indicates a certain value. For example, @Me indicates
the person who is running the query. For more information, see Macros and
variables later in this article.
The name of another field. For example, you can use [Assigned to] = [Changed
by]  to find work items that are assigned to the person who changed the work
item most recently.
For a description and reference names of all system-defined fields, see Work item field
index.
Queries use logical expressions to qualify result sets. These logical expressions are
formed by one or more conjoined operations.
Some simple query operations are listed below.
WHERE
    [System.TeamProject] = @project
    AND (
        [System.WorkItemType] = 'Product Backlog Item'
        AND (
            [System.AssignedTo] = @me
            OR [Microsoft.VSTS.Common.ClosedBy] = @me
        )
    )
Filter conditions
Operators


# Page 1240

WIQL
The table below summarizes all the supported operators for different field types. For
more information on each field type, see Work item fields and attributes.
The =, <>, >, <, >=, and <=  operators work as expected. For instance, System.ID >
100  queries for all work items with an ID greater than 100. System.ChangedDate > '01-
01-19 12:00:00'  queries for all work items changed after noon of January 1, 2019.
Beyond these basic operators, there are some behaviors and operators specific to
certain field types.

You can use the terms AND  and OR  in the typical Boolean sense to evaluate two clauses.
You can use the terms AND EVER  and OR EVER  when specifying a WAS EVER  operator. You
can group logical expressions and further conjoin them, as needed. Examples are shown
below.
WIQL
You can negate the contains, under,  and in  operators by using not . You can't negate
the ever  operator. The example below queries for all work items that aren't assigned
under the subtree of Fabrikam Fiber\Account Management .

Macros or variables
ﾉ
Expand table


# Page 1243

Macro
Usage
@Me
Use this variable to automatically search for the current user's alias in a field
that contains user aliases. For example, you can find work items that you
opened if you set the Field column to Activated By, the Operator column to
=, and the Value column to @Me.
@CurrentIteration
Use this variable to automatically filter for work items assigned to the
current sprint for the selected team based on the selected team context.
@Project
Use this variable to search for work items in the current project. For example,
you can find all the work items in the current project if you set the Field
column to Team Project, the Operator column to =, and the Value column
to @Project.
@StartOfDay
@StartOfWeek
@StartOfMonth
@StartOfYear
Use these macros to filter DateTime fields based on the start of the current
day, week, month, year, or an offset to one of these values. For example, you
can find all items created in the last 3 months if you set the Field column to
Created Date, the Operator column to >=, and the Value column to
@StartOfMonth - 3.
@Today
Use this variable to search for work items that relate to the current date or to
an earlier date. You can also modify the @Today variable by subtracting
days. For example, you can find all items activated in the last week if you set
the Field column to Activated Date, the Operator column to >=, and the
Value column to @Today - 7.
[Any]
Use this variable to search for work items that relate to any value that is
defined for a particular field.
The @me  macro replaces the Windows Integrated account name of the user who runs the
query. The example below shows how to use the macro and the equivalent static
statement. The macro is intended for use with identity fields such as Assigned To .
WIQL
You can use the @today  macro with any DateTime field. This macro replaces midnight of
the current date on the local computer that runs the query. You can also specify
@today+x  or @today-y  using integer offsets for x days after @today  and y days before
@me macro
WHERE  
   [System.AssignedTo] = @Me 
@today macro


# Page 1244

@today , respectively. A query that uses the @today  macro can return different result sets
depending on the time zone in which it's run.
The examples below assumes that today is 1/3/19.
WIQL
Is the equivalent of:
WIQL
And
WIQL
Is the equivalent of:
WIQL
You can use the @StartOf...  macros with any DateTime field. This macro replaces
midnight of the current day, start of week, start of month, or start of year on the local
computer that runs the query.
These macros accept a modifier string that has a format of (+/-)nn(y|M|w|d|h|m) .
Similar to the @Today  macro, you can specify plus or minus integer offsets. If the time
unit qualifier is omitted, it defaults to the natural period of the function. For example,
@StartOfWeek("+1")  is the same as @StartOfWeek("+1w") . If the plus/minus (+/-) sign is
omitted, plus is assumed.
WHERE  
   [System.CreatedDate] = @today
WHERE  
   [System.CreatedDate] = '01-03-2019'
WHERE  
   [System.CreatedDate] > @today-2
WHERE  
   [System.CreatedDate] > '01-01-2019'
@StartOfDay, @StartOfWeek, @StartOfMonth,
@StartOfYear macros


# Page 1245

This syntax allows you to nest modifiers and offset your query twice. For example, the
clause Closed Date >= @StartOfYear - 1 , filters work items that have been closed since
last year. By modifying it to Closed Date >= @StartOfYear('+3M') - 1 , it excludes work
items closed within the first three months of the last year. The WIQL syntax is as shown
in the following example.
WIQL
The following examples assume that today is 4/5/19.
WIQL
Is the equivalent of:
WIQL
And
WIQL
Is the equivalent of:
WIQL
WHERE 
   [Microsoft.VSTS.Common.ClosedDate] >=@StartOfYear('+3M') - 1
WHERE  
   [Microsoft.VSTS.Common.CreatedDate] >= @StartOfMonth-3
WHERE 
   [Microsoft.VSTS.Common.CreatedDate] >= '01-01-2019'
WHERE 
   [Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.TargetDate] > @StartOfYear
WHERE 
   [Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.TargetDate]  > '01-01-2019'
Custom macros


# Page 1246

WIQL also supports arbitrary custom macros. Any string prefixed by an @  is treated as a
custom macro and gets substituted. The replacement value for the custom macro is
retrieved from the context parameter of the query method in the object model. The
following method is the API used for macros:
C#
The context parameter contains key-value pairs for macros. For example, if the context
contains a key-value pair of (project, MyProject), then @project gets replaced by
MyProject  in the WIQL. This replacement is how the work item query builder handles
the @project macro in Visual Studio.
You can use an ASOF  clause in a query to filter for work items that satisfy the specified
filter conditions as they were defined on a specific date and time.
Suppose a work item was classified under an Iteration Path of Fabrikam Fiber\Release
1  and assigned to 'Jamal Hartnett' prior to 5/05/2022. However, the work item was
recently assigned to 'Raisa Pokrovskaya' and moved to a new iteration path of Release 2.
The following example query returns work items assigned to Jamal Hartnett because the
query is based on the state of work items as of a past date and time.
WIQL
public WorkItemCollection Query(string wiql, IDictionary context)
Specify historical queries ( ASOF )
７ Note
You can’t create ASOF  queries in the query builder in Visual Studio. If you create a
query file (.wiq) that includes an ASOF  clause, and then load that in Visual Studio,
the ASOF  clause is ignored.
SELECT
    [System.Id],
    [System.Title],
    [System.State],
    [System.IterationPath]
FROM workitems
WHERE
    [System.TeamProject] = @project
    AND [System.WorkItemType] <> ''
    AND ([System.IterationPath] UNDER 'Fabrikam Fiber\Release 1'


# Page 1247

You can use the ORDER BY  clause to sort the results of a query by one or more fields in
ascending or descending order.
The following example sorts work items first by Priority in ascending order (default), and
then by Created Date in descending order ( DESC ).
WIQL
To return links between work items, you specify FROM WorkItemLinks . Filter conditions in
the WHERE  clause may apply to the links or to any work item that is the source or the
    AND [System.AssignedTo] = 'Jamal Hartnett <fabrikamfiber4@hotmail.com>') 
    ASOF  '01-05-2022 00:00:00.0000000'
７ Note
If no time is specified, WIQL uses midnight. If no time zone is specified, WIQL uses
the time zone of the local client computer.
Set the sort order ( ORDER BY )
７ Note
The sorting preferences of the SQL server on the data tier determine the default
sort order. However, you can use the asc  or desc  parameters to choose an explicit
sort order.

Quote string literals (single or double quotes are supported) in a comparison with a
string or plain text field. String literals support all Unicode characters.
WIQL
You can use the contains operator to search for a substring anywhere in the field value.
WIQL
You can use the UNDER  operator for the Area and Iteration Path fields. The UNDER
operator evaluates whether a value is within the subtree of a specific classification node.

subtree.
WIQL
You can use some modifiers and special operators in a query expression.
Use the IN  operator to evaluate whether a field value is equal to any of a set of values.
This operator is supported for the String, Integer, Double, and DateTime field types. See
the following example along with its semantic equivalent.
WIQL
The EVER  operator is used to evaluate whether a field value equals or has ever equaled a
particular value throughout all past revisions of work items. The String, Integer, Double,
and DateTime field types support this operator. There are alternate syntaxes for the
EVER  operator. For example, the snippets below query whether all work items were ever
assigned to Jamal, Raise, or Christie.

As your organization grows, you want your tools to scale to support your growing
business needs. Azure Boards tools scale primarily by supporting the addition of teams.
Each team provides configurable tools that allow teams to focus on their set of work.
For guidance on adding teams, see About teams and Agile tools.
Enterprise project managers often have a portfolio of projects that they manage. These
projects are typically developed by several teams. By creating a hierarchy of teams,
portfolio managers can gain insight into the tools being developed by their teams.

Manage your product and portfolio
backlogs
Article • 11/26/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Portfolio backlogs give product owners insight into the work of multiple agile feature
teams. Product owners define high-level goals as Epics or Features, which feature teams
break down into user stories to prioritize and develop.
Setting up a team structure like the one shown provides each feature team with a
distinct backlog to plan, prioritize, and track their work. Portfolio or product owners can
create their vision, roadmap, and goals for each release, monitor progress across
projects, and manage risks and dependencies.
To support the following elements, set up a hierarchical team and backlog structure:
Organize and manage backlogs: Enable autonomous feature teams to organize
and manage their own backlogs.
Plan and monitor: Use portfolio management views to plan epics and features and
monitor the progress of feature teams.
Assign backlog items: Assign backlog items to feature teams from a common
backlog.

Access levels: Have at least Basic access.
Permissions: To configure team settings, be part of the Project Administrators
security group or have the Team Administrator role. For more information, see
Change project-level permissions.
In the following example, we show the Epics portfolio backlog for the Management
team. Drilling down, you see all the backlog items and features, even though they
belong to one of three different teams: Customer Service, Phone, and Web.
７ Note
The images in your web portal might differ from those in this article due to updates
made to Azure DevOps Services. However, unless explicitly mentioned, the basic
functionality remains the same.
Manage view of team progress


# Page 1261

Each team has its own home page or dashboards, product and portfolio backlogs,
boards, and Taskboards. These pages show work relevant only to each team, based on
assignments made to the work item area and iteration paths. For more information, see
About teams and Agile tools.
To visualize ownership and progress involving other teams, do the following tasks:
） Important
You can establish child links with work items from different projects. But, if the
processes differ between projects, the hierarchy isn't visible on the backlog for
those child items in separate projects. You can still view all associated child items
directly on the work item form.
Visualize team backlog ownership and progress


# Page 1262

Show parent items: Configure your backlog to show parent epics or features
owned by other teams.
Use queries: Create queries to include work items from other teams. Add these
queries to your team’s dashboard for better visibility.
Utilize Plans: Use the "Plans" feature in Azure Boards, which gives you cross-team
visibility into work items across multiple teams. This action lets you see all backlog
items and features, even if they belong to different teams.
For example, the Fabrikam Fiber Team's backlog view includes work items assigned to
their area path, Fabrikam Fiber, and the parent Epic, which is assigned to the Fabrikam
team. Items owned by other teams appear with an information icon, 
 . Hover over the
information icon for the Epic to see more details.
The hierarchical team and backlog structure enables autonomous teams to take
ownership of their backlogs and allows for assigning work to teams from a common

backlog. During sprint or product planning meetings, product owners and development
leads can review the backlog. Teams can then assign specific items to various teams by
setting the feature team Area Path.
In the following view of the Account Management backlog, all items still assigned to
Account Management have yet to be assigned to specific teams.
During the planning meeting, open each item, make notes, and assign it to the
appropriate team for action.
In the following example, all backlog items were assigned to feature teams while all
features and epics remain owned by Account Management.
 Tip
Select multiple work items and perform a bulk edit of the area path. For more
information, see Bulk modify work items.


# Page 1264

If you need more than three backlog levels, add more. For more information, see
Customize your backlogs or boards for a process.
The simplest way to track dependencies across teams is to link work items using the
Related link type. For time-based dependencies, use the Predecessor/Successor link
types. You can then create queries to find work items with these relationships. For more
information, see Link work items to other objects.
Using Delivery Plans, you can track dependencies across projects within an organization.
For more information, see Track dependencies using Delivery Plans.
To view feature progress based on linked requirements, add a rollup column or view a
delivery plan. For more information, see Display rollup and Review delivery plans.

Configure a hierarchy of teams
Article • 11/26/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
In Portfolio Management, we explore how management teams and feature teams can
use their backlogs to prioritize and focus on the most critical work items. This article
helps you configure teams to optimally support the distinct backlog views tailored for
both management and feature teams.
Effective team configuration is essential for ensuring that each team has a clear and
focused view of their responsibilities and priorities. By setting up a hierarchical team
structure, you can:
Enhance collaboration: Foster better communication and teamwork across
different functions.
Streamline workflow management: Simplify processes and reduce bottlenecks.
Align with organizational goals: Ensure that all teams are working towards
common objectives.
Promote accountability and efficiency: Increase visibility into each team's
workload, promoting responsibility and productivity across projects.
Customized backlog views: Each team can prioritize and manage their work based
on their specific goals and responsibilities.
Improved visibility: Management and feature teams gain clear insights into their
respective workloads and progress.
Enhanced focus: Teams can concentrate on the most critical tasks without getting
overwhelmed by unrelated work items.
Efficient workflow management: Streamlined processes lead to faster decision-
making and project execution.
By implementing a hierarchical team structure, you ensure that your organization
remains agile, focused, and aligned with its strategic objectives.
Why effective team configuration matters
Key benefits
Prerequisites


# Page 1267

Project access: Be a project member
Permissions:
Be a member of the Project Administrators security group.
The first step is to add a team for each feature team and management area. You can
also rename teams that you already added. When you're done, you have a set of teams
similar to the ones shown.
1. From the web portal, choose Project settings and open Teams.
Add a team for each management area


# Page 1268

2. Choose New team. Give the team a name, and optionally a description.


# Page 1269

Repeat this step for all feature and management teams you want to create.
In this step, you want to move the areas paths associated with feature teams from a flat
structure to a hierarchical structure.
Move area paths into a hierarchical structure
ﾉ

# Page 1270

Flat area structure
Hierarchical area structure
To move area paths into a hierarchical structure, do the following steps:
1. Select (1) Project settings, expand Work if needed, and select (2) Project
configuration > (3) Areas.


# Page 1271

2. Next, choose the 
 actions icon for one of the area paths associated with a
feature team and select Edit. Then change the Location to move it under its
corresponding management team area path.
For example, here we move the Customer Profile to under Account Management.


# Page 1272

Repeat this step for all feature team area paths.
By including subarea paths for the management teams, you automatically include the
backlog items of their feature teams onto the management team's backlog. The default
setting for all teams is to exclude subarea paths.
To define both areas and iterations do the following steps:
1. Select Project settings > Teams, and then choose the team whose settings you
want to modify.
Here we open the Account Management team.
Include subarea paths for management teams
７ Note
Sub-area paths may break a team's ability to reorder or reparent items on the
backlog. Also, it can introduce uncertainties with regards to assignments made to
the board Column, Done, and Lane fields. For more information, see Exercising
select features with shared area paths later in this article.


# Page 1273

2. Select Iterations and areas > Areas.
To switch the team context, use the team selector within the breadcrumbs.


# Page 1274

3. Choose Select area(s), and select the area path for Account Management and
check the Include sub areas checkbox.
Verify that only this area path is selected for the team and is the default area path.
Remove any other previously selected area paths.
Repeat this step for all your management areas. If you want to enable rollup across
all feature teams and management areas to the top-level area, repeat this step for
the default team. In our example that corresponds to Fabrikam Fiber.
If your feature teams use Scrum or use sprints to assign their work, set up a series of
sprints that all teams can use. By default, you see a set of predefined sprints. Add more
sprints and set their sprint dates from Project Settings as described in Add iterations
and set iteration dates. You can rename and edit the default sprints as needed.
Define a single sprint cadence for all teams
７ Note


# Page 1275

For teams to be well defined, add team administrators and have them verify or
configure other team settings. For more information, see Manage and configure team
tools.
From Project Settings>Project configuration>Areas, you can review which Area Paths
are assigned to which teams. To modify the assignments, choose the team and change
the team's area path assignments.
While maintaining a single sprint cadence simplifies project administration, you can
create different cadences as needed. For example, some teams may follow a
monthly cadence while others follow a 3-week cadence. Simply define a node
under the top project node for each cadence, and then define the sprints under
those nodes. For example:
Fabrikam Fiber/CY2019
Fabrikam Fiber/3Week Sprints
Here we define the start and end dates of the first 6 sprints corresponding to a 3-
week cadence.
Configure other team settings
Review area paths assigned to teams


# Page 1276

When you share area paths across two or more teams, understand how Azure Boards
manages conflicts that can arise when exercising these features:
Reordering or reparenting work items on a backlog or board
Updates made to Board column, Board column done, and Board Lane fields when
dragging items to a different column
All backlogs and boards support drag-and-drop functionality for reordering and
reparenting work items. Changes made in one team's backlogs and boards are
automatically reflected in other team backlogs and boards that share the same area
path. You might need to refresh the page to see these updates.
Exercising select features with shared area
paths
Reordering and reparenting work items


# Page 1277

Drag-and-drop can only be used to reorder or reparent work items that are assigned to
area paths selected for your team. When the Parents view option is enabled, work items
that your team doesn't own might appear in your backlog. Any work item marked with
the 
 information icon can't be reordered or reparented, as another team owns it.
Because each team can customize their board columns and swimlanes, the values
assigned to board fields might differ when another team updates a work item from a
different board. Even if the management team and the feature teams configure their
Feature board columns with identical workflow mappings, updates made to work items
on one team's board don't automatically reflect on another team's board. The card
column updates consistently across all boards only when a work item moves to a
column that maps to a workflow state.
By design, the team with the longest area path takes precedence in resolving conflicts
and determines the values for the Board Column, Board Column Done, and Board Lane
fields. If two or more teams share area paths of equal depth, the results are
nondeterministic.
The primary workaround is to maintain single ownership of work items by defining area
paths and assigning them to a specific team. Alternatively, you can add custom
workflow states that all teams can use uniformly. For more information, see Customize
the workflow (Inheritance process).

Review team delivery plans in Azure
Boards
Article • 09/17/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022
Use the visualization options provided by the Delivery Plans feature of Azure Boards to
review the schedule of stories or features that your teams plan to deliver. A delivery plan
shows the scheduled work items by sprint (iteration path) of selected teams against a
calendar view.
Use the Delivery Plans feature to ensure that your teams are aligned with your
organizational goals. You can view multiple backlogs and multiple teams across your
whole account. Interact with the plan by using simple drag-and-drop operations to
update or modify the schedule, open cards, expand and collapse teams, and more.
Delivery Plans supports the following tasks:
View up to 20 team backlogs, including a mix of backlogs and teams from different
projects.
Add custom portfolio backlogs and epics.
View work items spanning several iterations.
Reset start and target dates using drag-and-drop borders.
Add backlog items to a team directly from a plan.
View rollup progress of features, epics, and other portfolio items.
View dependencies between work items.
Enable stakeholders to view plans.
Any plan that you created with the original Delivery Plans extension works with the
Delivery Plans feature. You don't have to migrate any data or reconfigure plan settings.
For more information, see Add or edit a delivery plan.


# Page 1280

For information on working with dependencies, see Track dependencies.
Access levels: To view a delivery plan, be a member of the Project Collection Valid
Users group. Users granted Stakeholder access for a private project can view plans.
Users granted Stakeholder access for a public project can add and view plans.
Permissions: To open or modify a work item or add work items to a plan, have Edit
work items in this node set to Allow for the area paths assigned to the work item.
For more information, see Set permissions and access for work tracking.
For work items and dependency lines to appear on the plan:
Work items must belong to a team's product backlog or portfolio backlog. Only
work items that belong to a category selected for viewing on a team's backlog
appear on the plan.
Team product or portfolio backlog must be enabled.
Sprints must be selected for each team defined in the plan.
Start and end dates must be defined for each iteration.
Iteration paths must be assigned to each work item.
For dependency icons and lines to show, work items must be linked via the
Predecessor-Successor link type or other custom dependency link type. (Remote
link types aren't supported.) You can add custom link types only for on-premises
environments.
Prerequisites
 Tip


# Page 1281

It takes multiple autonomous teams to develop large software projects. Autonomous
teams manage their own backlog and priority, which contributes to a unified direction
for that project. Review Agile culture for a discussion of autonomous teams and
organizational alignment.
Regular reviews of the project schedule with these teams help ensure that the teams are
working toward common goals. Delivery plans provide the needed multiple-team view
of your project schedule.
Questions that you might address during the review include:
How confident are the teams in meeting the deliverables scheduled for each sprint?
Are dependencies across teams adequately addressed via the planned deliverables?
Are there gaps in the schedule, where no deliverables are scheduled? What's the
cause? Can the issue be mitigated?
For example, you might use delivery plans internally to share the schedule of features.
By seeing the work that many teams planned for the next three sprints, you can easily
see if a plan has the right priorities and spot dependencies.
In this way, a delivery plan is a driver of alignment while letting each team remain
autonomous. Individual teams can work to different sprint cadences, if needed, and
manage different work item types (stories, features, or epics). Their work is all visible
with the same plan view. Teams can even be part of different projects if they use
different processes. Customize the card fields so that you see only the data fields that
interest you and that apply for each work item type.
Determine how you want to use the delivery plan. Some ideas include:
Reviewing quarterly plans for features to be delivered.
Syncing up monthly with several teams that have dependencies.
Reviewing cross-project deliverables and identifying dependencies.
Use a consistent sprint schedule across your project teams and organization when
possible. Although the plan can accommodate various sprint schedules, it adds to
If you edit a plan and the changes that you make don't seem to appear in the plan,

visual clutter. Use the same sprints for backlogs, features, and epics. Avoid creating
specific sprints for epics or other portfolio backlogs.
Use Start Date and Iteration to specify the time frame for a work item, or use Start
Date and Target Date. However, don't specify both Iteration and Target Date for a
work item. Target Date always overrides the Iteration end date on the plan.
Minimize the number of fields displayed on your cards.
Eliminate cross-team ownership of area paths to avoid undesirable edge cases.
Keep your work items up to date. When changes occur, update the target dates or
iteration paths.
Be aware of the following:
Plan views display the set of months that correspond to the iteration paths
selected by the teams whose backlogs appear in the plan.
Plan views are limited to a maximum of 20 teams or backlogs.
Zooming out can cause fields and tags to disappear from the cards. The farther
you zoom out, the harder it is to fit items on a card. Certain items might be
hidden, depending on the zoom level.
Rollup isn't supported for child work items that belong to a different project
than that of the originating parent work item.
If Start Date or Target Date is missing from a work item, you can add it to the
custom process defined for the project, as discussed in Add and manage fields
(inheritance process).
After you define a few plans, they appear on the Plans page under All or Favorites,
showing the title, description, and most recent creator/editor.
Use Add to favorites 
 to favorite a plan for quick access. You can also search for
other plans in the project.
To open a plan, go to Boards > Delivery Plans and select the plan name. You can sort by
any of the columns: Name, Created By, Description, Last configured, or Favorites.

# Page 1283

Each team's backlog specified in a delivery plan appears as a row within the plan view.
When a row is collapsed, a rollup of the backlog items is displayed. When a row is
expanded, cards for each backlog item appear, organized by their assigned iteration.
Interact with a plan


# Page 1284

Use your plan in the following ways:
Filter the plan: Select Filter 
 . You can filter on any field that you include in the
plan. Settings are based on the keyword or text filter. For more information, see
Interactively filter your backlogs, boards, and plans.
Scale the size of the cards and calendar: Select Zoom out 
 or Zoom in 
 .
View previous or future months: Select Scroll calendar left 
 or Scroll calendar
right 
 . You can also scroll through the plan by selecting the plan and dragging
your mouse horizontally.
View details for a team: Select Expand team row.
Expand and collapse all team rows: Select Expand all team rows or Collapse all
team rows next to Teams.
Scroll the view vertically to view teams that appear lower within the plan view.
View titles only: Select Collapsed card fields 
 . To view all fields, select
Expand card fields 
 .
Select a card title to open the backlog item and view details. Close the work item
to return to the plan.
Add a work item to a sprint: Select Add item 
 within the sprint and team that
you want to add it to.
Change the fields displayed on the cards: Select More actions 
 .
One of the benefits of Delivery Plans is the ability to view multiple teams across the
projects you care about. Here are two main ways to view more teams within the plan
view:
Collapse all teams to focus on summary data.
Minimize the number of fields displayed on cards.
To gain a summary view of scheduled work, collapse all teams. This makes it easier to
identify gaps in the forecast.
 Tip
Work items appear in the prioritized order listed for the sprint backlog, inheriting
the priority from the product backlog.
Collapse teams for summary information


# Page 1285

Expand or collapse each team row by selecting Expand team row or Collapse team row
next to the team name.
For work items that span one or more iterations, set the Start Date and Target Date. The
plan will display cards that start and end according to these dates, as shown in the
following image. You can also adjust the start or target date by dragging the left or right
border of a work item.
Show work that spans one or more iterations
View titles only in the collapsed card view


# Page 1286

The collapsed card view lets you easily toggle between cards that show only titles and
cards that display all fields configured for the plan. To view titles only, select Collapsed
card fields 
 . To view all fields, select Expand card fields 
 .
A rollup provides a comprehensive view of the underlying work directly on the cards in
your delivery plan. Rollup views are available for features, epics, or any portfolio backlog
you have added to your project. To enable rollups, open your plan settings, select Fields,
and then choose Show child rollup data.
For example, the following plan view shows four scenarios with a rollup of the child
features, user stories, and bugs for a single team.
You can also view rollups from a backlog view, as described in Display rollup progress or
totals.
As the schedule changes, update the iteration for a backlog item by moving the card to
a different iteration. This adjustment helps maintain alignment across your organization.

Track dependencies by using Delivery
Plans
Article • 11/26/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022
With Delivery Plans, you can track dependencies that have been added to work items.
Dependency tracking supports the Predecessor/Successor link type between work
items. The following image shows several work items that have dependencies. Those
cards with a 
 green icon indicate there are no dependency issues. Those cards with
a 
 red icon indicate there are issues with one or more dependencies. Dependency
issues arise when a predecessor work item is scheduled to finish after a successor work
item.
To view dependencies, you must first define the Delivery Plan and dependencies
between work items. To learn how, see Add or edit a Delivery Plans and Link user stories,
issues, bugs, and other work items.

When conflicts arise, they are highlighted in red. These issues typically occur when a
successor work item's end date is set before the predecessor work item's end date. To
determine the end date, use either the Target Date for the work item or the End Date of
the assigned Iteration Path.
For example, the Dependencies dialog below shows that two predecessor work items
are scheduled to complete before the successor work item. A red exclamation mark and
red arrows indicate an issue with this dependency.

Interactively filter backlogs, boards,
queries, and plans in Azure Boards
Article • 11/22/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Filter functions in Azure Boards empower you to interactively apply one or more filters
to streamline your work item management. Each Azure Boards tool—such as Backlogs,
Boards, and Query results—comes prefiltered to display a relevant subset of work items
based on its specific functionality:
Backlogs and boards: Show work items based on the selected Area Paths and
Iteration Paths for your team.
Query results: List work items that match the query clauses you defined.
To enhance your filtering capabilities, enable the filter feature by selecting the 
 Filter
icon.
Even with these initial filters, you might still encounter a large number of work items.
Interactive filtering allows you to narrow down your view and focus on a specific subset
of work items by applying more filter criteria to each Azure Boards tool.
Filters can significantly enhance your workflow by helping you accomplish the following
tasks:
Daily scrum meetings: Focus the board on work assigned for a specific sprint to
facilitate effective stand-ups.
Sprints Taskboard: Filter to view a particular team member's completed work,
aiding in performance reviews and accountability.
Group work items: Concentrate on related work items by filtering based on Parent
Work Item, Area Path, or Tags, enhancing organization and clarity.
Triage work items: Create and apply queries to isolate similar work items grouped
by Area Path or Tags, enabling efficient issue resolution and backlog grooming.
Use cases for filters


# Page 1297

By using these filter functions, your team can maintain focus, improve productivity, and
ensure that critical tasks receive the attention they deserve.
For more detailed information on using filters, see Filter Backlogs, Boards, and Plans.
Project access: Be a project member.
Filter functions are available from all Azure Boards tools: Work items, Boards, Backlogs,
Sprint Backlogs and Taskboards, Queries, and Delivery Plans. The set of features
supported depends on the tool and Azure DevOps version. (Use the content selector to
view the filters available for your version.)
The following table indicates the supported options based on the tool indicated with a

you can add the Parent field as a column and then do a keyword/phrase search on
the Parent title to effectively filter on parent work items. The Parent field is
supported for Azure DevOps Server 2020 and later versions. See also the Parent

Notes
1. The Work items page is subject to filters based on the view selected. Boards and
Backlogs are subject to filters defined for the team as described in Set up your
Backlogs and Boards. Completed and In Progress work items get determined
based on the state categories assigned to the workflow state as described in How
workflow states and state categories are used in Backlogs and Boards.
2. Grouping is supported through portfolio backlogs and boards, parent-child links,
and tree hierarchy. Tree hierarchies are flattened when filtering is applied and
reinstated when filtering is cleared.
3. Backlogs and Sprint Backlogs support reordering. However, when filtering is
enabled, reordering isn't supported.
4. Taskboards provides a Group by function based on People or Stories.
5. Query Results supports multi-column sort.
6. Work items appear in the order defined for the team Sprint backlog, which it
inherits from the team product backlog.
7. Semantic search supports sorting search results by the following fields—Assigned
To, Changed Date, Created Date, ID, State, Tags, Title, and Work Item Type—and
Relevance.
For more information about these other functions, see the following articles:
Reorder cards (boards)

# Page 1303

The Parent Work Item filter enables you to focus on one or more select features or
epics. This filter function was added in July 2016 and made available in Azure DevOps
Server 2017 and later versions.
The Parent field was added to Azure Boards in July of 2019 and then made available
with the release of Azure DevOps Server 2020. You can add the Parent field to a list
through the Column Options dialog, except for the Work items tool. You can also add
the Parent field to cards on the boards and Taskboards.
Once you set filter options for a specific view, your settings persist until you modify
them. There's no need to select a save button or take any other actions.
To filter work items based on specific fields, first add the field as a column or to the card.
For example, to filter by Assigned To, Iteration Path, Work Item Type, or any other
field's content, ensure these fields are displayed on the cards, backlog, plan, or list.
All filter configurations are user-specific and remain active until you clear them.
To add columns or fields, see the following articles:
For Backlogs and Queries, see Change column options
For Boards, see Customize cards
For Taskboards, see Customize a sprint Taskboard
For Plans, see Review team delivery plans.
1. From the Azure Boards tool, choose the view you want. For example:
For Work items, select Assigned to me, Following, Mentioned, or other view.
For Backlogs and Boards, select the backlog level you want, such as Stories,
Features, or Epics.
For sprint Backlogs and Taskboards, choose the iteration
For queries, define the query filter criteria of interest.
Parent Work Item filter and Parent field
Persistence and saving filter options
７ Note
You can't set default filter options or configure filters for other team members.
Open and clear filter functions


# Page 1304

2. Choose any other view settings available for your view. For example:
For Work items, from the View options menu, enable/disable Completed
Work Items.
For Backlogs, from the View options menu, enable/disable In Progress items
or Completed Child items.
For Taskboards, from the Person menu, choose All, Unassigned, or a specific
team member.
3. For list views, add columns to display fields containing text you want to filter on or
possibly sort on. For card views, add fields to display on cards containing text you
want to filter on.
4. Select Filter 
 . Or, enter the Ctrl+Shift+f keyboard shortcut.
For example, here we open the filter toolbar for the board, Backlog items.
::: moniker-end
5. Choose your filters of interest.
The filter icon changes to a solid icon, Filter 
 , to indicate filtering is applied.
The page refreshes to show only those work items that meet all the selected filter
criteria.
When filtering is applied, the following functions are disabled or altered:
For backlogs, the add-a-backlog-item panel, reordering (stack ranking), and
forecasting tools are disabled.
For backlogs set to Show Parents, the tree hierarchy is flattened, unless you enable
the Keep hierarchy with filters from the View Options menu. See [Filter your
backlog and maintain the hierarchy](#keep hierarchy) provided later in this article.
To clear and dismiss filtering, choose Clear and dismiss filtering 
 .
Inactive functions
Clear or dismiss filtering


# Page 1305

Filters remain in place until you explicitly clear them. When you refresh your backlog,
board, or other tool, or sign in from another browser, filters remain set to your previous
values.
Once the board is filtered, you can choose the filter icon to hide the drop downs and
view the applied filters on the board. The filter icon turns opaque to signify a filtered
board.
You can filter your backlog and maintain the hierarchy of work by choosing show
Parents and Keep hierarchy with filters from the View Options menu. Use these options
when you want to show work items assigned to one or more team members, work item
types, area or iteration paths, or combination of these items and keywords. The
hierarchy is maintained and work items that match the filter criteria are shown in bold
text.
Filter your backlog and maintain the hierarchy


# Page 1306

Applying Boolean operators to filters is only supported for tags, as described in Filter
based on tags later in this article. All other filters are applied with an implicit AND
operator.
The keyword filter allows you to search lists or cards based on the fields configured
through Column Options or board settings. You can filter by specific values, such as IDs
even if the ID field is visible. When using the keyword filter, ensure that the fields
containing the desired text or tags are displayed in your view.
The filter criteria ignore the following characters: ,  (comma), .  (period), /  (forward
slash), and \  (back slash).
Here we filter the board to only show those cards that include 'web' either in the title,
tag, or field.

 Tip
Filtering is case-insensitive.

Filter a board using a keyword


# Page 1307

Here we filter the Backlog with Show Parents enabled, to only show work items that
include 'web'.
The filtered set is always a flat list, even if you selected to show parents.
With filtering turned on, choose one or more values from the multi-select drop-down
menu for each field available to you. The values for these fields are populated as follows:
Area: The Node Name, which specifies the last node of an Area Path, of valid Area
Paths and for which there are work items assigned to that Area Path
Assigned To: All users who are currently assigned to work items on the board plus
Unassigned
Iteration: All Iteration Paths selected for the current team and for which there are
work items assigned to that iteration
Work item type: Work item types defined for the Requirements Category (product
backlog) or Features or Epic categories (feature or epic portfolio backlogs), subject
to work items being assigned to the work item types
Tags: All tags assigned to work items on the board
Parent Work Items: All features defined for the team, or all epics defined for the
team when viewing the Features board
Filter a backlog by using a keyword
Filter based on a field
７ Note


# Page 1308

You can filter by select field values using the board for your product backlog (Stories,
Product Backlog Items, or Requirements) or a portfolio backlog (Features or Epics).
For example, here we filter for all items assigned to Jamal and Raisa.
Cards are filtered based on the assignments made in the following order and logic:
1. Assigned to: Show all cards that are assigned to user 1 OR  user 2 AND
2. Iteration: Show all cards that are assigned to Iteration 1 OR  Iteration 2 AND
3. Work Item type: Show all cards that are work item type 1 OR  work item type 2 AND
4. Tags: Show all cards that have tag 1 AND  or OR  tags 2, based on your selection of
AND | OR . AND
5. Parent Work Items: Show all cards that have Parent Work Item 1 OR  Parent Work
Item 2.
Filter options are dependent on the work items that meet the filter criteria. For
example, if you don't have any work items assigned to Sprint 4, then the Sprint 4
option won't appear in the filter options for the Iteration Path.
The values that populate the filter options are based on the work items that are
currently loaded and displayed. For example, if you have a backlog with 2,000 work
items, but only 1,000 are displayed on a board, the filter options are based on just
the items displayed.
Filter a board by using select field values
Board filter logic


# Page 1309

Here we show a filtered backlog based on the keyword "issues." Filtered pages show the
 filtered icon. The filtered set is always a flat list, even if you selected to show a
hierarchical backlog view.
You can use the Filter by parent feature to filter by select parent work items using the
board for your product backlog (Stories, Product Backlog Items, or Requirements) or a
portfolio backlog (Features).
Use this feature only when you created features or epics and linked them to user stories
or features, respectively. A quick and easy way to create the links is to map them using
drag-and-drop. Mapping creates parent-child links between the work items.
To start filtering, choose Filter 
 . Choose one or more values from the multi-select
drop-down menu for the Parent Work Item. These values are derived from the Features
you defined.
Here, we choose two features on which to filter the board:
Filter a backlog by using fields
Filter based on the Parent Work Item
７ Note
The Filter by parent feature doesn't support filtering of parent work items of the
same work item type. For example, you can't filter the Stories backlog by specifying
user stories that are parents of nested user stories.


# Page 1310

The final board displays just those stories linked as child work items to the selected
features.
If you added tags to your work items, you can filter your work using one or more tags.
For backlogs and query results, add Tags as a column option before filtering on tags.
Check the boxes of those tags that you want to filter on. Keep the OR selection to do a
logical OR for all the tags you selected. Or, choose the AND option to do a logical AND
on all the selected tags.
Filter based on tags


# Page 1311

For more information about tags, see Add tags to work items to categorize and filter
lists and boards.
In addition to all the filter features described earlier in this article, you can also filter the
history view within a work item form.
To quickly find revisions made that contain a keyword, or made by specific people or to
a specific field, enable the filter feature by choosing 
 Toggle filter.

either a Start Date and End Date or an Iteration Path.
1. Sign in to your organization ( https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization} ).
2. Select Boards > Delivery Plans.
3. Select New Plan.
All users have permissions to create a plan and manage the plans they create.
4. Enter a name and description, and specify the team backlogs that you want to
appear within your plan.
When you define your plan, know the following guidelines:
Add a plan


# Page 1315

Name and description: Use the name and description fields to clearly identify
your plan within the project.
Team selection: You can choose one or more teams from any project defined
in the organization or collection. There can be up to a maximum of 15 teams.
Active backlogs: Select one or more active backlogs for a team. If you
encounter issues selecting a backlog level, check the Team Backlog settings
to ensure the backlog level is enabled for the team. For more information,
see Select backlog navigation levels for your team.
Reordering backlogs: You can reorder the team backlogs by dragging and
dropping them into the desired sequence.
Filtering work items: To filter for specific work items, specify the field criteria.
For example, to exclude bugs from the view, add the following criteria: Work
Item Type <> Bug .
For more information, see Query fields, operators, and macros in Azure Boards.
Once you define a plan, you can modify or further customize it.
1. Select Settings from your Delivery Plan.
Edit a plan


# Page 1316

2. Choose the page you want to edit based on the customizations you want to make.

Field
criteria
Specify field criteria to filter work item types displayed on the plan. All criteria are
evaluated as an AND statement. If no fields are specified, then all work item types
that appear on the teams backlog level appear on the plan.
Markers
Add up to 30 milestone markers to the plan. Specify a label and select a color.
Fields
Add or remove fields from cards to display on the plan, similar to how you customize
them for your board. You can't add rich-text (HTML) fields, such as the Description
field, to a card even if it appears in the list. These field types represent too many
challenges to format on a card.
Styles
Add styling rules to change card color based on field criteria.
Tag colors
Add tags and specify a tag color. Optionally enable or disable a tag color.
Display fields that are relevant for your review purposes or contain keywords that you
want to use for filtering your plan. Unlike a board, you can't change the field displayed

Make sure your work items are assigned to an Iteration Path, or a Start Date and Target
Date. Also, verify that the Iteration Paths have been selected for the teams whose
backlog levels are chosen for the Delivery Plans. If the Iteration Paths aren't selected,
work items associated with those iterations won't display.
Select the bottom of the card to show the dependency lines of the work item. To turn
them off, select the bottom of the card or anywhere else in the plan. Clicking the
bottom of the card is a toggle for the display of the dependency lines.
In the settings under the Fields section, you can add fields display on the cards.
However, depending on the number of fields and the zoom level, not all fields are
displayed. Selective field display based on zoom level is a design decision that was
made to avoid card clutter. To see all the fields and tags on a card, continue to increase
(+) the zoom level until they fully display.
Yes. Add your custom work item type to a backlog level as described in Customize your
backlogs or boards (Inheritance process).

Implement Scaled Agile Framework® in
Azure Boards
Article • 03/25/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Many enterprises benefit from individual Agile teams. Greater interest grows to scale
Agile practices as the organization grows. The need for enterprises to view progress of
many Agile teams and across a portfolio continues to increase. To address these needs,
many businesses have adopted the Scaled Agile Framework® (SAFe®).
If you're familiar with Scrum but not familiar with SAFe®, see SAFe Studio Framework
.
Azure Boards supports SAFe® practices through its autonomous teams, backlogs,
boards, reports, and metrics. This article introduces you to how Azure Boards artifacts
support SAFe practices and artifacts.
The SAFe® addresses how a portfolio vision is met by a hierarchy of teams, all
concerned with specific goals. This framework breaks down Epics into Features and
Stories. Teams work on these items in Sprints and deliver through Program Increments
(PIs) and Release Trains. Furthermore, the portfolio backlog can track deliverables that
map to value streams and associated budgets.
The Scaled Agile Framework®

７ Note
This article is one of a set of Scaled Agile Framework® tutorials that applies to
Azure Boards and Azure DevOps Services. Most of the guidance is valid for both
the cloud and on-premises versions. However, some of the features and procedures
are specific to the cloud or the latest version of Azure DevOps Server.

Essential SAFe®


# Page 1331

All of these artifacts and practices are supported by Azure Boards.
Stories, Features, and Enablers: Implemented as work items that capture
information and status of work. These work items automatically appear on team
backlogs and boards.
Team Backlogs and Program Backlogs: Implemented as team backlogs that filter
work items assigned to a team and support prioritizing and grouping of work.
Scrum and Kanban: Practices that are fully supported using boards, Sprint
backlogs and Taskboards, teams, and sprint cadences.
Iterations, Innovation and Planning (IP) Iteration, Program Increments (PI),
Milestones, and Release Trains: Implemented via a flat-list or a hierarchical
configuration of Iteration Paths.
Agile Release Train: Implemented by a set of Agile teams and Program teams
configured to support specific team and program views.
PI Objectives, Team Goals, and Solution context: Teams can use the built-in
project wiki to share objectives, goals, customer information, and solution
requirements.

Portfolio SAFe®


# Page 1332

Azure Boards provides supports for the following portfolio components:
Epics: Map to the Epic work item type and allow tracking, grouping, and rollup of
child items.
Portfolio backlogs: Implemented as a portfolio backlog that supports filtering of
work based on review of business needs.
Portfolio Vision and Strategic Themes: Business owners and portfolio managers
can use the built-in project wiki to share their vision, objectives, and goals.
Value Streams: Value streams can be tracked using tags or custom fields.
Lean budgets: Budget information can be captured in custom fields and rolled up
to gain visibility to the Feature and Epic levels.
KPIs: Several reports and dashboard widgets provide out-of-the box metrics.
Power BI and the Analytics service provide support to create custom reports
quickly.
Large Solutions SAFe® includes support for a Solution Backlog, Solution Trains, and
Capabilities.

How SAFe® concepts map to Azure
Boards artifacts
Article • 09/17/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
If you're interested in using Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe®), you can configure your
Azure Boards project to track SAFe® deliverables. Just as Azure Boards supports Scrum
and Agile practices, it can support SAFe® and large numbers of teams to work together
on Epics that span releases.
This tutorial illustrates how the following SAFe® artifacts map to specific Azure Boards
artifacts.
For an overview of how Azure Boards implements Scrum and Kanban, see About Sprints,
Scrum, and project management and About Boards and Kanban.
The following image illustrates how you can configure Azure Boards to support a three-
level team hierarchy and map teams to their respective area and iteration paths. The
examples build from the Agile process, However, the changes can be applied to any
project and process hosted on Azure Boards.

７ Note
This article is one of a set of Scaled Agile Framework® tutorials that applies to
Azure Boards and Azure DevOps Services. Most of the guidance is valid for both
the cloud and on-premises versions. However, some of the features and procedures
are specific to the cloud or the latest version of Azure DevOps Server.


# Page 1340

Examples provided below illustrate how a three-level team hierarchy is configured using
hierarchical area paths. The examples build from the Agile process, However, you can
apply these changes to any project hosted on Azure Boards.
Azure Boards supports each team to have its own view their work. By configuring a
hierarchical team structure, each team can focus on their work, and have their work roll
up to the next level within the team hierarchy.
Agile feature, program, and portfolio teams


# Page 1341

To support SAFe® teams, you reconfigure the default team as the Portfolio team to
manage your epics. You then create subteams for program-level work and team-level
work. Work can be tracked across teams and throughout each of the levels.
All work and deliverables are captured in work items. Each work item is associated with a
specific work item type with a predefined workflow. Each Azure Boards process provides
support for specific work item types that you can use to track any of the SAFe®
deliverables.
The work item types available to you're based on the process used when your project
was created—Agile, Basic, Scrum, or CMMI—as illustrated in the following images.
The following image shows the hierarchy for the Agile process backlog work item:
Stories, Features, Epics, Enablers, and
Capabilities
Agile process


# Page 1342

User Stories and tasks are used to track work.
Bugs track code defects.
Epics and features are used to group work under larger scenarios.
Each team can configure how they manage Bug work items at the same level as
User Story or Task work items. Use the Working with bugs setting. For more
information about using these work item types, see Agile process.
The items in your backlog may be called User Stories (Agile) Issues (Basic), Product
backlog items (Scrum), or Requirements (CMMI). All four are similar: they describe the
customer value to be delivered and the work to be completed.
You can track Enablers using User Stories or Features, and Capabilities using Features or
Epics. Or, you if you have specific tracking and reporting needs, you can add custom
work item types to track these types of deliverables. For more information, see
Customize Azure Boards, Add custom work item types.
Work items provide support for the following tasks:
Add description and acceptance criteria
Assign to a team or area path and to a project member
Update status and assign to an iteration or sprint
Link work items, attach files, add tags
Add comments and view a discussion thread
Product and portfolio backlogs enable teams to quickly add and prioritize their User
Stories, Features, and Epics. For more information about work items and work item
types, see Track work with user stories, issues, bugs, features, and epics.
Team backlogs and boards


# Page 1343

SAFe® backlogs map to team, program, and portfolio backlogs. Out of the box, the
Agile process supports User Story, Feature, and Epic backlog levels. The hierarchical
backlog structure shows work done to support Features and User Stories in the progress
of an Epic.
You can customize your backlog and boards, even adding portfolio backlogs, as
described in Customize Azure Boards, Customize backlogs.
The board view of each backlog is configurable by each team.
SAFe® Release Trains, Releases, Iterations, Program Increments (PIs), and Sprints map
easily to your iteration paths. By sharing iterations across the team hierarchy, you
manage the releases in a cohesive manner.
Program Increments, releases, and sprints


# Page 1344

Because epics can span several release trains, the Portfolio team isn't associated with
any specific iterations. Program teams track their Feature deliverables, which ship with a
PI. And Feature teams work in Sprints to complete several stories. Each team chooses
which iterations support them to track their focused set of deliverables.
SAFe® practices include Agile release teams defining their iteration goals and
objectives. We recommend using the project wiki or team dashboards to capture team
information. The project wiki and team dashboards both support Markdown to add and
format information.
Iteration goals and objectives


# Page 1345

For more information, see Share information later in this article.
You can use tags for a quick and easy way to map Features and Epics to their Value
Streams, Strategic Themes, and associated Budgets. You can add custom fields to
capture budget estimates for Features that can then roll up to Epics.
With tags that you add to work items, you can:
Filter any backlog or board
Create queries based on tags, and filter query results by tags
Create progress and trend charts or reports based on tags
For a more robust mapping of work to architecture or business features, you can specify
the Value Area for each Epic, Feature, or Story.
Value streams and budgets


# Page 1346

With rollup, you can get Budget Estimates for Epics from a rollup of the estimates
defined to their child Features, as shown in the following image.
To add custom fields, see Customize Azure Boards, Add a custom field.
Information can be widely shared with an organization using the Azure DevOps project
wiki. The wiki is a similar to a git repository that supports adding and editing pages
using Markdown and a WYSIWYG editor. It versions each page so that it's easy to track
who made changes and recover past versions.
Use your project wiki to support sharing the following SAFe® artifacts:
Portfolio Vision
Strategic Themes
Taxonomy
Goals
Objectives
Customer-centric practices
For more information about the project wiki, see Share information later in this article.
The end of each Program Increment, Sprint, Release Train, or Innovation and Planning
(IP) Iteration represent natural SAFe® milestones. Many milestones are associated with
specific ceremonies or practices, such as conducting retrospectives or demonstrating
working software.
In Azure Boards, you can track other types of milestones or key events in the following
ways.
Use the project wiki to support your portfolio
vision and strategic themes
Milestones and key events


# Page 1347

Custom field, such as Milestone or Release field with predefined picklist
As a tag added to work items
As a work item that specifies a target date
As a one-day Iteration Path
With custom fields and tags, you can quickly filter backlogs, boards, and queries based
on a specific milestone.
Resources that are shared across teams can be represented through their own Agile
feature team, such as a UX Design team or a Security Compliance team. They can
manage their backlog while having their work also appear in the backlogs of the teams
they support.
Here we show how area paths are assigned to the UX Design team, and then selective
subarea paths to other Agile teams. Work items that appear on shared area paths
appear on the backlogs and boards of the associated teams.
To support teams doing retrospectives and reviews, we recommend using the
Retrospectives extension by Microsoft DevLabs
.
Shared services team structure
Retrospectives and reviews


# Page 1348

This extension allows teams to create their own retrospective boards and capture the
following tasks:
Collect feedback on project milestones
Organize and prioritize that feedback
Create and track actionable tasks to help each team in their improvement
processes.
Azure Boards provides many ways to share information.
Work item forms provide rich-text fields to capture descriptions, acceptance
criteria and more. File attachments can be added to work items or links to network
file shares.
Project and team dashboards can be used to share information along with status
and progress charts and widgets. For more information, see Add Markdown to a
dashboard.
The Project wiki provides a central repository with versioning control built-in to
share information with all project members. Other wikis can be created as needed.
For more information, see About Wikis, READMEs, and Markdown.
For details on supported Markdown features, see the following articles.

Configure Azure Boards to support
SAFe® programs and portfolios
Article • 12/06/2023
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
This tutorial walks you through the steps to convert a new project with a single team to
one that is configured to support Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe®) programs and
portfolios. Specifically, you'll learn how to configure Azure Boards to support SAFe®
programs and portfolios by completing the following tasks:
You'll need to be a member of the Project Administrators group to make these
configurations.
Once you've completed these core configurations, you can then consider customizing
your project to support specific business needs. Customization options are addressed in
Customize Azure Boards to support SAFe® .
If you're new to Azure Boards, we recommend that you review About teams and Agile
tools and About area and iteration (sprint) paths before adding and configuring your
teams. Also, two excellent articles to review around team structure and Agile culture are
Introduction to planning efficient workloads with DevOps and Building productive,
customer focused teams.
Define Agile, program, and portfolio teams
＂
Configure a hierarchy of Area Paths to support your teams
＂
Define Iteration Paths to support SAFe® release trains, PIs, sprints, and IPs
＂
Configure each team to support SAFe®
＂
 Tip
If you plan to add custom work item types, portfolio backlogs, or workflows; you
may want to make those customizations first and then define and configure your
teams.
７ Note
This article is one of a set of Scaled Agile Framework® tutorials that applies to
Azure Boards and Azure DevOps Services. Most of the guidance is valid for both


# Page 1351

In this article, we'll go from having one project and one team, both named "Fabrikam",
to the following set of nine teams.
the cloud and on-premises versions. However, some of the features and procedures
are specific to the cloud or the latest version of Azure DevOps Server.
Prerequisites
Understand team hierarchy


# Page 1352

We'll then configure the area path to the following hierarchy and configuring each
team's area path. This configuration supports each team's backlog view and rollup of
views within the hierarchy.
７ Note
Azure Boards doesn't support a hierarchy of teams. However, by configuring the
Area Paths as indicated in this article, you effectively create a type of team
hierarchy. The hierarchy is defined through the structure of Area Paths.


# Page 1353

All teams can manage their own workload and priorities while clearly understanding
how their work supports those epics managed in the portfolio team's backlog. At the
same time, the portfolio team can monitor progress of its backlog on their own board,
prioritize the items on their backlog, and view progress across release trains.
While the above may sound complicated, it actually takes little configuration to set up
the teams and get started. To go from one project with one default team, first define
each team while automatically creating a default area path for that team. Then
reconfigure the flat set of area paths to a hierarchical structure. Next, define the iteration
paths to support the release structure you want and the program and Agile teams to
use. Lastly, configure each team and populate the membership of teams.
To start, we'll add each team, creating a default area path for each. Later in this article,
we'll configure those area paths into the necessary hierarchy. This structure maps the
following SAFe® teams to Azure Boards teams:
Portfolio team -> default top-level team, the Fabrikam team (already defined)
 Tip
If you have a large number of teams, area paths, and iterations that you need to
add, you may want to use command line or programmatic tools. See the Command
line and programmatic tools provided later in this article.
Define your teams


# Page 1354

Program teams -> secondary-level teams, Fiber Suite, and Service Suite
Agile teams -> tertiary-level teams defined under Fiber Suite and Service Suite.
Add each team, one by one.
1. From the web portal, choose Project settings and open Teams.
2. Choose New team.
７ Note
The following procedure uses the New Teams Page user interface that is in preview.
To enable this feature, see Manage or enable features.


# Page 1355

3. Give the team a name, and optionally a description.
Here we add the App team. Choose the team administrator and ensure the Create
an area path with the name of the team checkbox is checked. Optionally add
team members.


# Page 1356

Assign the team's Scrum Master, Program Manager, or Portfolio Manager as the
team administrator. As team administrators, they can configure their team's tools
to support their Agile practices and business needs.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 to define all teams.


# Page 1357

5. Optional. If you have two or more Portfolio teams, create a team for each of them.
To support your team hierarchy, you'll now configure the area paths created in the first
step of defining teams into a hierarchy.
1. From the Project Settings page, choose Project configuration and then Areas. You
should see a flat list of Area Paths.
2. You'll want to choose each feature team's Area Path under the top Area Path and
move it under the Area Path hierarchy to which it belongs.
You can drag and drop each area path under the parent node where it belongs. For
example, here we drag the Migrate node to the Fiber Suite node.
Configure Area Paths


# Page 1358

Instead, you can open the context menu for the Area Path, choose Edit, and select
the node where you want to move it.
3. Repeat step 2 and 3 for the remaining Agile team area paths.
If you've defined two or more portfolio teams, you'll need to change the move
each program team's area path under their corresponding portfolio team's area
path.
4. When finished, your area path structure should appear similar to the following
image.
） Important
This structure shows that area paths are owned by Agile teams, program
teams, and the portfolio team. We'll correct this structure later in this article
when we configure each team to be the sole owner of its area path.


# Page 1359

To track progress towards Releases, create your iteration path structure. Unlike area
paths, multiple teams can share the same iteration path structure. Sharing the iteration
structure lets multiple teams work in the same sprint cadence towards the same release
trains.
If you already have iterations for your default team, you can rename them. You'll want to
create an iteration structure that supports your entire team structure, not just one team.
1. From the Project Settings page, choose Project configuration and then Iterations.
2. Under the default iteration, which shares the same name as the project, create a
child iteration that represents your first program increment (PI). Optionally, add a
start and end date for the PI, but keep in mind that the iteration gets broken down
further into sprints.
Define Iteration Paths
） Important
Deleting, renaming, or moving iteration paths causes a loss of associated historical
data.


# Page 1360

3. Next, create a child iteration for each Sprint within the PI. Set dates for these
sprints to correspond your Agile teams' cadences.


# Page 1361

4. Continue to add as many iterations as needed to meet the time box cadence
structure for all your teams.
When finished, you should have a structure similar to the following image.


# Page 1362

Now that your teams, Area Paths, and Iteration Paths are defined, the next step is to
configure each team. You'll want to configure the following settings for each team.
Active backlogs
Working with bugs
Set default Iteration Path
Select team Iteration Paths
The following table lists the recommended settings to make based on the team level.
Configure
Agile feature team
Program team
Portfolio team
Backlog navigation levels
Features, Stories
Features, Stories
Epics
Working with bugs
Bugs are managed with requirements
Bugs are not managed on backlogs and boards
Bugs are not managed on backlogs and boards
 Tip
You can drag and drop Iteration Paths to structure your iterations, similar to as
shown in Step 2 under Configure Area Paths. Azure Boards always lists the
iteration paths in order of their dates under each parent node.
Configure your teams

Exclude sub areas
1. From the Project Settings page, choose Team configuration.
Choose the team you want to configure from the Team selector.
７ Note
By setting the Default Iteration to @CurrentIteration, all work items created from
the team's backlog or board are assigned to the current iteration based on the
current date. By setting the Backlog Iteration to the root, Fabrikam, indicates that
only the Area Path acts as a filter for work items to appear on the team backlogs
and boards.


# Page 1364

2. On the General page, uncheck backlogs you don't want to be active.
For example, for the Portfolio team, only check the Epics checkbox.
For program and Agile teams, uncheck the Epics checkbox.


# Page 1365

3. For program and portfolio teams, choose the Working with bugs radio button as
shown.
And, for Agile teams, choose the Working with bugs option to track bugs along
with requirements.
4. Choose the Iterations tab to configure the team's iterations.
For Agile teams, configure the settings as shown.


# Page 1366

For program teams, choose only the PI iterations.
5. For program and portfolio teams, choose the Areas tab to change the default
setting from Include sub areas to Exclude sub areas.


# Page 1367

Open the 
 context menu, and choose Exclude sub areas.
6. Repeat steps 2 through 5 as needed for each team you need to configure.
7. After you've completed step 5 for all teams, verify the Area Path-Team structure.
Choose Project configuration and Areas. The Area Path and team structure should
now appear as shown, where each team owns their Area Path and doesn't share it
with any other team.
７ Note
Because we created each team with the Create an area path with the name of
the team checked, each team is already preconfigured with their default area
path. This Area Path acts as the main filter for work items that appear on each
team's backlogs and boards.


# Page 1368

For teams that support several other teams, such as a UX Design team, configure your
teams as described in the following steps.
1. Add a team for each Shared Services team. Refer to Define your teams for details.
2. Return to the Project configuration>Area Paths page and under each shared
services area path, add sub area paths for each Agile team supported by the
shared services. For more information, see Configure Area Paths provided earlier in
this article.
For example, here we add four sub area paths under the UX Design area path, one
for each Agile team supported by the UX Design team.
3. Configure each Shared Services team as an Agile feature team as described in
Configure your teams.
4. For each Agile team, open the Team configuration>Areas page as shown in Step 5
of Configure your teams. Choose Select areas and add the sub area path for that
Configure teams to support Shared Services


# Page 1369

team.
Here we add the UX Design\App sub area path to the App feature team.
5. Return to the Project configuration>Area Paths page and verify that the Area Path
structure appears as expected for each Shared Services area path.
For the UX Design team, the structure should appear as shown.
Work items that appear on shared area paths appear on the backlogs and boards
of the associated teams.

Customize Azure Boards to support
SAFe® practices
Article • 12/06/2023
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
The main reason to customize your process is to support progress tracking and
monitoring, report key metrics, and meet specific business needs. This article covers
some process customizations that you can implement and explains why you may want
to adopt them to complement your Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe®) practices. Most of
these customizations are optional.
Learn how Azure Boards supports SAFe® practices through the following operations:
Project access: Be a project member
Permissions:
Be a member of the Project Administrators security group.
Azure Boards provides a graphical user interface to support customization of your
projects. This feature is called the Inherited process. All projects that use an inherited
process are automatically updated when customizations are made to that process.
Customize work item types or add custom work item types
＂
Add a custom field or customizing existing fields
＂
Customize the workflow
＂
Add custom rules to a work item type
＂
Add custom controls or custom extensions
＂
Customize your backlogs or add a custom portfolio backlog
＂
７ Note
This article is one of a set of Scaled Agile Framework® tutorials that applies to
Azure Boards and Azure DevOps Services. Most of the guidance is valid for both
the cloud and on-premises versions. However, some of the features and procedures
are specific to the cloud or the latest version of Azure DevOps Server.
Prerequisites
About customization and the inherited process


# Page 1372

For an overview of all the customizations you can make to an inherited process, see
About process customization and inherited processes.
Each work item type defines the fields that capture and store information. You can
customize existing work item types in the following ways to support specific SAFe®
tracking requirements.
Add a custom field to support tracking budget costs, value streams, or customer-
centric information
Customize existing fields, such as modifying the picklist or changing a field label
Add custom rules to make select fields required or specify actions to take under
select conditions
Change the workflow to reflect your team's workflow process
Add a custom control or extension to support custom functions such as a
calculated field
For more information on customizing a work item type, see Add and manage work item
types.
You can add a custom field to support tracking data requirements that aren't met with
the existing set of fields. Some fields to consider adding to one or more work item types
include those items listed in the following table.
Field name
Work Item Types
Notes
Budget cost
Feature, Epic
Use to capture estimated costs. Can use rollup to capture the total estimated cost of an
Epic's Features.
Category or Group
Customize work item types
Add a custom field


# Page 1373

Feature, Epic, User Story
Use to specify a picklist to indicate the work item is cataloged as one of the following
SAFe® categories: Feature, Capability, Enabler, or Solution.
Milestone
Feature, Epic, User Story
Use to specify a picklist of Milestone of Events which a story, feature, or epic should
meet.
Value Stream
Feature, Epic, User Story
Use to specify a picklist to support a taxonomy of value streams you want to associate
with work.
For more information, see Add a custom field to a work item type.
You can capture a value stream using a field or tags. Tags represent a more informal and
adhoc method for categorizing work. A specific field, particularly one with preset items,
is more formal. When determining how you want to use tags and fields, consider the
following statements:
You can make a field required through custom rules, however, you can't require
tags be added to a work item
You can create query charts based on custom fields, however, you can't specify a
tag for use in query charts
You can filter backlogs, boards, and queries based on fields or tags
The number of tags created can quickly grow as anyone can add new tags as long
as they have the correct permissions
You customize existing fields to support one or more of the following actions:
Relabel the name of the field
Change where the field appears or remove it from the form
Field versus tags usage
Customize existing fields


# Page 1374

Add or change a picklist (drop-down menu). For example, the Value Area provides
two options, Business and Architectural. You can add to this picklist of values
Change the default assignment made to a field
Make a field required
Add a rule to a field as described in the next section
For an index of existing fields, see Work item field index. For more information on
customizing a field, see Add and manage fields for an inherited process.
Field rules provide support for many business use cases. Rules specify an action to take
based on a selected condition. For example, you can make a field required based on the
value assigned to another field. You can add several rules to a field.
The following images show the supported conditions and actions you can select from.

You may want to customize the workflow for User Stories, Features, and Epics so that it
matches your workflow process. By customizing the workflow early, you minimize the
board configuration teams must do.
The default workflow for the Agile process includes New, Active, Resolved, and Closed
states. While each team can add workflow columns to their board, you might want to
customize the workflow to track these columns instead. That way the boards for all
teams are set up to use the same workflow states.
For example, you can add and rename workflow States to match the columns shown in
the following image—Backlog, Analyze, Develop, Test, and Done.
Discuss with your team which workflow states best support their Agile practices. For
more information, see the following articles:

With custom controls, you can add rich functionality to a work item form. A custom

The User Story, Feature, and Epic work item types are meant to support product
planning and tracking. However, other work item types might be useful to support your
SAFe® organization's customer-centric focus. Specifically, you might want to add work
items to capture customer feedback, customer requests, and more.
When you define a new work item type, think through the following items:
Information you want to capture, track, and report on
How work is captured
The workflow to support tracking the work
To keep things simple, however, it's always best to minimize the amount of
customizations you make. So, if you can get by with existing work item types, you might
consider adding custom field(s) as needed to track specific information.
Each team's backlog and board is designed to support specific work item types. For the
Agile process, the following work item types are as used.
Agile Release Teams: User Stories and Bugs (optional)
Program Teams: Features
Portfolio Teams: Epics
However, you can include more work item types, either existing ones or customized
ones, into these backlogs. Each team can subscribe to the set of backlogs that they need
to track.
You can also add up to three more portfolio backlogs as shown in the following
illustration. Portfolio backlogs are designed to be hierarchical.
Add custom work item types
Customize your backlogs


# Page 1377

For more information, see Customize your backlogs or boards (Inheritance process).
You add the following Marketplace extensions to get access to many rich features that
support SAFe.
Delivery Plans
Feature Timeline and Epic Roadmap
Dependency Tracker
Retrospectives
 Tip
You may want to add a Solution (Capabilities) Backlog that appears as a parent of
the Program (Features) Backlog. This SAFe configuration isn't achievable via the
Backlog Levels page. As a less-than-ideal workaround, you can disable the inherited
Epic work item type and recreate it as a custom work item type. For more
information, see Customize process backlogs and boards.
Add even more functionality

Plan and track SAFe® programs and
portfolios in Azure Boards
Article • 11/26/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Once you configure your Agile tools to support SAFe®, you can establish trace
relationships from Stories all the way up to Epics, ensuring comprehensive visibility and
alignment across your initiatives. Additionally, you can monitor progress at the portfolio,
program, and feature team levels, enabling more informed decision-making and
strategic planning.
This article guides you through the essential tools and techniques for planning and
tracking your SAFe® programs and portfolios, helping you effectively manage and scale
your Agile practices.
Project access: Be a project member
Permissions:
Be a member of the Project Administrators security group.
To get started, each team needs to add work items for each deliverable that supports
the product vision. Each team can do that by working from their backlog and then
mapping their work to create a hierarchy of work.
Or, they can develop a list of work items and import them using Excel. By specifying
each team's area path for each work item, they create the mapped hierarchy.
The following sections indicate how to work from Excel or through the web portal.
７ Note
This article is one of a set of Scaled Agile Framework® tutorials that applies to
Azure Boards and Azure DevOps Services. Most of the guidance is valid for both
the cloud and on-premises versions. However, some of the features and procedures
are specific to the cloud or the latest version of Azure DevOps Server.
Prerequisites
Define portfolios and epics


# Page 1380

You can import work items using Excel. As shown in the following image, Epics, Features,
and User Stories are defined in a tree-list with their Value Area, Area Path, and a few tags
defined. The State value is New.
Once you publish the list, work item IDs are assigned. Each team can then start working
with their work items, adding details, and assigning work to team members and to
sprints.
For more information about bulk update, see the Bulk add or update work items section
provided later in this article.
We recommend you use the project wiki to capture and share the Portfolio Vision,
Strategic Themes, and other information relevant to your programs. Consider defining
and sharing the following information:
How to use tags or custom fields to specify value streams
Taxonomy terms as described in Scale Agile to Large Teams
How release trains and sprints are used
Key milestones and events
Import a top-down plan by using Excel
Document Portfolio Vision and Strategic Themes


# Page 1381

Customer-centric programs
Information can be easily shared and updated by any member of the team. For more
information about using the project wiki, see About Wikis, READMEs, and Markdown
1. Open the Fabrikam team's Epics portfolio backlog and choose New Work Item.
Enter the title of the Epic and choose Add at selection.
2. Continue adding epics as needed by continuing to type in their titles. You can add
details later.
When finished, you should have a list of epics as shown:
3. As needed, you can drag and drop epics within the list to reflect their priority.
4. Define details. Choose each work item title to open the form. Add information to
the Description, assign to an owner, add tags, and choose the Value Area.
Here we assign the first epic to Jamal, add a Description, and specify Business for
the Value Area.
Define and prioritize the Epics portfolio backlog


# Page 1382

To update several work items in bulk, see Bulk add or update work items section
provided later in this article.
In a similar fashion to portfolio teams, program teams work from their Features backlog
and define the features that support the Epics they're tasked with delivering.
７ Note
Since an important aspect of SAFe® is to map work to business or architecture
goals, you'll want to make sure to set the Value Area=Architectural for any Feature
mapped to an architecture epic. Because the default choice is Business, you don't
have to change the field for any item that supports a business epic. You can also
add tags to track the investment.
The same principles apply to Stories in progress. You can map them to Features,
change the Value Area to Architecture for work that you do to support architectural
epics, and add tags for tracking themes.
Define programs and features


# Page 1383

Each program manager defines and prioritizes their features. Here, we show the Fiber
Suite team add Features.
1. Open the Fiber Suite team's Features backlog and choose New Work Item.
Enter the title of the Feature and choose Add at selection.
2. Continue adding Features as needed by continuing to type in their titles. You can
add details later.
When finished, you should have a list of Features as shown. The Node Name
indicates the last node in the area path specified for the work item. By adding
Features from the team's Feature Backlog, the Area Path is automatically assigned
the team's Default Area Path. For the Fiber Suite, that is Fabrikam\Fiber Suite.
3. As needed, you can drag and drop Features within the list to reflect their priority.
4. Define feature details. Choose each work item title to open the form. Add
information to the Description, assign to an owner, add tags, and choose the Value
Area.
Define the Features backlog
Map Features to Epics


# Page 1384

In this next step, you'll map each Feature to its parent Epic. The Mapping tool quickly
creates parent-child links between Epics and Features.
1. From the Features backlog, choose the 
 view options icon and select Mapping.
2. Choose the Fabrikam Team's backlog of Epics.
3. One by one, drag each Feature onto its parent Epic.


# Page 1385

4. When finished, choose the 
 view options icon and enable Parents and turn
Mapping off.
Your list should look something like that shown in the following image. The 
 info
icon appears next to each Epic, indicating that the work item is owned by another
team than the one currently selected.
In a similar manner to portfolio and program teams, each Agile feature team add Stories
to their backlog to support the Features assigned to them.
Define Agile feature team deliverables


# Page 1386

1. Open the App team's Stories backlog and choose New Work Item.
Enter the title of the User Story and choose Add at selection.
2. Continue adding User Stories as needed by continuing to type in their titles. You
can add details later.
When finished, you should have a list of Stories as shown:
3. As needed, you can drag and drop User Stories within the list to reflect their
priority.
4. Define story details. Choose each work item title to open the form. Add
information to the Description and Acceptance Criteria, assign to an owner, add
tags, specify the Story Points, and choose the Value area.
Define the Stories backlog


# Page 1387

To update several work items in bulk, see Bulk add or update work items section
provided later in this article.
Just as you earlier mapped each Feature to its parent Epic, now you'll map each User
Story to its parent Feature. The Mapping tool quickly creates parent-child links between
Features and User Stories.
1. From the Stories backlog, choose the 
 view options icon and select Mapping.
Map Stories to Features


# Page 1388

2. Choose the Fiber Suite's backlog of Features.
3. One by one, drag each User Story onto its parent Feature.


# Page 1389

4. When finished, choose the 
 view options icon and enable Parents and turn
Mapping off.
Your list should look something like that shown in the following image. The 
 info
icon appears next to each Epic and Feature, indicating that the work item is owned
by another team than the one currently selected.
Each team's board provides a visual interactive space for the team to plan and update
status. With it, your team can track the critical information they need by seeing which
work items are in progress, where the bottlenecks are, who work is assigned to, and
more.
For an overview of board tools and usage, see About Boards and Kanban. Each team can
customize the boards columns, card fields, card styles, and more. For more information,
see Customize your boards.
View boards and update status
Open a board


# Page 1390

You open the board from any backlog by choosing the View as Board link.
Each board supports the following tasks:
Add work items and child work items
Update status through drag-and-drop
Add and specify the labels of each column
Configure the display of cards, add tags, fields, and apply rules
Configure swimlanes and set WIP limits
Assign values or update fields displayed on cards
Filter based on keywords and key fields
Child items of Epics are listed within each card. You can expand and collapse the list of
child items.
Portfolio board

Plan a sprint


# Page 1392

Each Agile release team can plan their sprints using the sprint planning tools. Starting
with sprint planning, each team can move their backlog items to a sprint using the
Planning tool.
As shown in the following image, the App team plans their sprints.
For more information about planning and conducting sprints, see the tutorials for Plan
and work a sprint.
In a similar manner to Agile release teams sprint planning, each program team can plan
a release train.
Here we show the Fiber Suite program team plan the releases for their features.
Plan a release train


# Page 1393

When creating and updating work items, understand what you can and can't do.
You can only assign a work item to one team member; if you need to assign similar
work to more than one user, copy the work item and make the assignment
Can only assign a work item to a single Area Path and Iteration Path
The quickest way to add backlog work items is from the backlog or board
You can use work item templates to quickly fill in work item fields
Common fields you may want to bulk update include:
Area Path
Assigned to
Iteration Path
Tags (Add or Remove)
Value Area
You can bulk update and change the work item type from the web portal. Or, if needed,
you can remove of delete work items. See the following articles:

View SAFe® progress, roadmaps, and
metrics
Article • 11/26/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
With your teams' backlogs and boards properly configured and operational, you're now
ready to begin viewing and monitoring progress effectively.
Azure Boards offers various in-context charts and dashboard widgets that enable you to
track and report on key SAFe® metrics. Specifically, Azure Boards provides access to the
following tools to help teams derive SAFe® metrics and monitor and report progress:
Roll-up columns on backlogs: Aggregate and visualize work items across multiple
backlogs.
In-context reports: Access detailed reports directly within your work items.
Managed query charts: Utilize various chart types such as pie, bar, stacked bar,
trend, and pivot to analyze data.
Dashboard widgets: Customize your dashboards with widgets that display
pertinent metrics and information.
Team and project dashboards: Create comprehensive dashboards tailored to
specific teams and projects.
Analytic views for Power BI reports: Use Analytic Views to integrate Azure Boards
data with Power BI for advanced reporting.
OData queries for Power BI reports: Use OData queries to fetch data for Power BI,
enabling rich data visualization and analysis.
For an overview of these tools, see About dashboards, charts, reports, & widgets.
Another essential backlog tool is Forecast, which teams can utilize during their iteration
planning sessions.
With your teams' backlogs and boards properly configured and operational, you can
now effectively view and monitor progress through rollup columns in each team's
backlog. The following example illustrates progress based on the completion of child
work items.
View progress rollup


# Page 1396

In addition to tracking completion of child work items, other rollup options include:
Progress by specific work item types: Monitor progress based on different
categories of work items.
Progress by story points: Track the total story points completed versus planned.
Count of work items: Keep a tally of work items completed within a specific
timeframe.
Sum of a numeric field: Aggregate numerical data related to work items for
comprehensive analysis.
For more detailed information on configuring and displaying rollup progress or totals,
refer to Display Rollup Progress or Totals.
Each team has access to their velocity through the in-context velocity report. These
reports show a bar chart count of planned, completed, completed late, and incomplete
work items for the last six or more iterations. As shown in the following example, the
chart also provides the average velocity calculated for the number of iterations shown.
View team velocity


# Page 1397

This average can be used to forecast work by plugging it into the forecast tool.
By assigning Story Points to each User Story, a team can determine how much work they
can complete using the Forecast tool. For details on its usage, see Forecast your product
backlog.
Use the Forecast tool


# Page 1398

Each Azure Boards backlog and board provide configurable CFD views. So each team at
every level of SAFe® implementation can monitor progress using these built-in charts.
The following image shows an example CFD chart for User Stories with all columns
displayed.
View the Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD)


# Page 1399

Teams can use their CFD to identify bottlenecks and monitor the batch size of work in
their various states.
In-context CFD charts are quickly accessible from each backlog and board view. Also,
CFD charts can be added to team and project dashboards. For more information, see
View/configure a Cumulative Flow Diagram.
Other metrics that teams use are derived from the Lead time and cycle time charts.
These charts can be added to a team dashboard and monitored to learn the following
information:
Lead time: Days on average to complete deliverables from date created
Cycle time: Days on average to complete deliverables from date work started
Number of outliers
Both Lead Time and Cycle Time widgets display as scatter-plot control charts. They
display summary information and provide several interactive elements. For more
information, see Cumulative flow, lead time, and cycle time guidance.

You can review roadmaps of SAFe® deliverables using the Delivery Plans, Feature Time,
and Epic Roadmap tools. Delivery Plans are fully configurable to show the teams and
work item types of interest.
Program teams can review roadmaps of the deliverables of their Agile Release Teams. As
an example, the following image shows a snapshot of the Fiber Suite teams story
deliverables.
View and update roadmaps
Review feature team Delivery Plans


# Page 1402

You can expand each feature team to see details. Story deliverables are assigned to the
PI 1 sprints. Delivery Plans are fully interactive, allowing you to drag and drop work
items to update their sprint assignments, or open work items to update fields, add
comments, and other information.
Portfolio teams can review the Features under development by their program teams. For
example, Features under development by the Fiber Suite team are shown in the
following delivery plan view. The Features under development show up under the
Program Increment timeboxes.
Review the portfolio features deliverable

Promote an Agile culture within your
team
Article • 11/16/2023
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
As your team grows, you want your tools to grow with it. And if you're an enterprise
adopting Agile methodologies, you want your Agile tools to support the business goals
of your enterprise.
However, successfully scaling Agile requires addressing both the culture and tools within
your organization.
Organizations that aspire to be agile need to consider the twin obligations of creating
alignment across the enterprise and supporting team autonomy. A team needs
autonomy to be efficient. And enterprises need alignment across teams and the
organization to be efficient.
Too much alignment with insufficient team autonomy leads doesn't support innovation
or agility of teams to get things done. Too little alignment with each team running their
own program doesn't provide the insight and coordination required to meet business
goals.
With the right level of alignment across the organization and team autonomy,
individuals get empowered to innovate and inspired to collaborate to meet business
goals.
As you plan how you want to grow your Agile tool set, consider the following areas.
These areas are key to creating enterprise alignment while developing team autonomy.
７ Note
New to Agile? For more information, see Agile Culture and Scaling Agile to Large
Teams.
Enable autonomy
Create alignment


# Page 1406

Area
Create alignment
Support autonomy
Product vision
The organization defines the goals and roadmap for the organization. You can define
goals as epics and features that show up on the portfolio backlog.
A team determines how to best meet the roadmap. The team breaks down goals into
user stories or product backlog items using their team backlogs.
Team structure
Based on business goals, organizations determine the number and size of teams.
Vertically structured feature teams lead to greater autonomy and efficiency.
With teams, there should be some established roles, such as product owner and
development leads, but also room to rotate roles. For example, team members can take
turns acting as Scrum Master, developing sprint demos, running sprint retrospectives, or
crafting sprint emails.
Development cadence
Agile organizations need to release products and feature updates at regular intervals.
Establishing regular release and sprint schedules promotes the rhythm of the business.
Each sprint--a time boxed iteration of constant duration between two and four weeks—
includes planning, executing, delivering value, reflecting, and engaging in continuous
improvement.
All teams manage their work within the set sprint cadence. The team provides input into
the length of sprint that works best for them.
The team chooses the Agile methods that work for them, Scrum, Kanban, or a mix of
both. The team also takes ownership of starting and acting on their own set of
continuous improvement practices.
It's possible for some teams to execute in shorter sprints. For example, if an organization
sets a 2-week sprint cadence, some teams may choose to operate in 1-week sprints,
while still aligning with the organizational schedule.
Communication cadence


# Page 1407

Just as sprints bring a natural rhythm to the flow of work, so too do regular
communications. By setting expectations for the types of communications they want to
see to stay aligned and how often they occur, organizations naturally create alignment
across teams and the enterprise.
Team sprint emails, bug bar status, and release team feature delivery status are
examples of such regular communications.
A team determines the details that they communicate and who develops the
communication. Their sprint emails may contain a summary of previous sprint
accomplishments and the next sprint plans or include a demo of recently completed
features.
Quality
Each organization needs to set the criteria and standards by which they assess quality
and set expectations for quality standards. A few ways they define the criteria are to set
exit criteria for new feature development, standards to manage technical debt, and bug
caps for teams or individuals.
Also, they can monitor bug status and trends by creating bug dashboards.
A team chooses how they meet the quality standards. They may stage bug bashes for
new features or at the end of each sprint. They may choose an individual to function as
a bug shield on a rotating basis.
Manage risk, track work
The organization determines how each functional unit communicates status and risk.
They establish a "contract of communication" as to the minimum required information
the organization needs.
Also, the organization provides the infrastructure to reduce risks. The organization owes
the teams anything they can do to reduce risks that are common across teams.
Beyond meeting the needs set by the organization, teams determine any other details
they need to manage and track to reduce their risks. Whether they use a white board
with sticky notes or a full Gantt chart, they manage the details. For example, teams may
add a backlog item to track a dependency they have on another team. Or they may
track their risks via a list of issues or impediments. Also, teams regularly contribute to
improving the process and infrastructure to support the organization's ability to manage
risk and gain insights.
Structure teams


# Page 1408

As you scale, one of the most important tasks to consider is how you structure your
teams. Traditionally, horizontal team structures divide teams according to the software
architecture: user interface, service-oriented architecture, and data teams.
However, with the adoption of Agile practices, vertical team structures that span the
architecture provide greater team autonomy. Vertical teams can deliver on the features
they own by working across the software architecture. They also spread the knowledge
needed to work at all architecture levels throughout all the teams.
Configure your teams along the value streams that your organization wants to deliver.
For example, Fabrikam Fiber, organizes their teams into the following seven feature
teams.
Each team plans the features to deliver. They have the autonomy to determine how to
structure the data, architect the services, and design the web and mobile user interfaces.
They plan in adherence with the quality standards set by the organization and to which
all teams contribute.
As your organization grows, you can scale your Agile tools in the following ways.
Add teams and filtered backlog views: You add teams to support team autonomy
and provide them with the tools they can configure and manage that supports
Configure your Agile tools to scale


# Page 1409

how they want to work. These tools include product backlogs, boards, sprint
backlogs, Taskboards, and others.
Also, you can configure teams to support a hierarchy of backlogs and portfolio
backlogs so that portfolio managers can review priority and progress across
several teams.
Set up sprints and releases: You can structure your iterations to support a flat set
of sprints, or a set of sprints embedded within scheduled releases. Each team
activates the set of sprints and releases that they need to participate in.
Manage portfolios: by setting up a hierarchy of teams and backlogs and activating
portfolio backlogs. Feature teams focused on a subset of the product backlog can
remain focused on just their backlog. Portfolio managers who want to view and
organize backlogs to track progress and dependencies can manage portfolio
backlogs of Features and Epics.
If you need other portfolio backlogs, for example, Scenarios or Initiatives, you can
add them as well.
Configure dashboards: With team dashboards, you can configure charts that track
progress within a team or across teams. Specifically, you can add status and trend
charts based on queries you create.
Group or categorize work: There are several ways to group work that you want to
track. Backlogs filter work items based on team area assignments. And portfolio
backlogs allow you to group backlog items under Features and Epics.
If you want to track and report on work items based on other groupings, you can.
You can add tags to work items and then filter backlogs or queries based on tags.
Also, you can add subarea paths to represent more granular feature areas.
Add folders and use team favorites: As your teams grow, you see a growing list of
work item queries, build definitions, and source code folders. By using folders,
subfolders, and team favorites, you can manage many of these lists more easily.
You can add team favorites for shared queries, source code, and build definitions.
Often, organizations look at adding a project for each software development project.
We recommend that you add teams to scale your tools rather than add projects for the
following reasons:
Scale with teams and not projects

Implement Agile practices that scale
Article • 05/31/2023
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Enterprise organizations adopt Agile practices for many reasons. Prime among these
reasons include:
Shorten time-to-market, accelerate product delivery
Improve organizational effectiveness to manage changing priorities
Enhance software quality and delivery predictability
Improve project visibility and reduce project risk
As your organization grows, you'll want to scale your practices to remain agile and meet
changing goals. To do that, consider these two guiding principles:
What does success look like to you, your teams, and your organization? What's of
most interest: On-time delivery? Product quality? Predictability? Customer
satisfaction?
Return to first principles, return to the principles and shared values enumerated in
the Agile manifesto
 As noted by Ken Schwaber
, one of the founders of Scrum:
"Values and principles scale, but practices are context sensitive."
"Keep the values, keep the principles, think for yourself. A core premise of Agile
is that the people doing the work are the people who can best figure out how
to do it."
By adopting a shared cadence and set of periodic communications, you create a
constant flow of activity throughout the organization. Practices that help create rhythm
and flow within larger organizations include:
Shared cadence: Regular sprints and releases establish the rhythm of the business.
Having all teams work to a shared cadence helps with all coordination and
collaboration activities.
Sprint emails: To keep the organization and all teams informed about the progress
and plans of feature teams, each feature team can email a summary of their
previous sprint results and current sprint plans.
Sprint demos: A quick--2 to 3 minute--video that illustrates a new feature the
team produced. Links to such videos can be included within sprint emails.
Create rhythm and flow


# Page 1412

Showcase meetings: To inform other teams and ask for feedback about software
under development, teams showcase the work they've done. Conduct these
meetings at regular intervals throughout the project lifecycle, and open them to all
interested parties.
Bug summary emails: To support insight into product quality and to encourage
maintaining bug discipline, periodically share quality metrics with the organization.
These metrics may include active bugs per feature team, bug trends, and bugs per
engineer.
Coordination meetings: Hold meetings that coordinate teams at either regular
intervals or as often as needed to address overlapping goals, dependencies, and
risks.
Engaging customers throughout your product lifecycle is a primary Agile principle.
Empower each team to interact directly with customers on the feature sets they own.
Continuous feedback: Build in customer feedback loops. These loops can take
many forms:
Customer voice: Make it easy for customers to give feedback, add ideas, and
vote on next generation features. Giving feedback is often done through a
dedicated website.
Product feedback: In-product feedback buttons are another way to ask for
feedback about the product experience or specific features.
Customer demos: Regularly scheduled demos that ask for feedback from your
customers can help shape next generation products and keep you on track to
build applications your customers want to consume.
Early adopter programs: Such programs should be developed with the idea that
all teams may want to participate as some point. Early adopters gain access to
early versions of working software, which they then can provide feedback. Often,
these programs work by turning on select feature flags for an early adopter list.
Data-driven decisions: Find ways to instrument your product to obtain useful data
and that can test various hypotheses. Help drive to an experiment-friendly culture
that celebrates learning.
The more insight you and your teams have into the goal, vision, and progress of the
work being done, the better enabled you'll be to reduce risks and manage
dependencies.
Interact with customers
Improve project visibility

Team structure: No matter how large your organization gets, structuring your
organization around small teams of 6 to 9 scales. Create vertical, autonomous
feature teams grouped under portfolio management areas.
Work breakdown structure: Breaking down large goals, features, or requirements
into smaller ones remains a stable of project management. By breaking down work
into similar-sized tasks, teams can make better estimates and identify risks and
dependencies.
Consolidated views: Use your online tracking tools to aggregate work to gain
knowledge across teams. Build dashboards to show progress and trends.
Experience reviews: These meetings, held before development begins on a
feature, are used to educate leadership on scenarios and priorities, collect
feedback, set expectations, and surface any cross-team issues about the feature.
Some specific Agile practices that scale well and lead to happier, engaged, and
productive employees include:
Embedded leadership: Empower teams and leaders within the organization to self-
organize and self-manage as much as possible. Team autonomy increases
organizational agility team effectiveness. Ensure teams have the corporate
sponsorship needed to succeed.
Daily stand-ups: Or, Scrum meetings help keeps teams focused on what they need
to do daily to maximize their ability to meet their sprint commitments. As
organizations grow, they should consider staggering these meetings so that cross-
team participation can occur as needed.
Scrum of scrums
: Daily stand ups of members from different Agile teams meet
daily to report work completed, next steps, and issues or blocks occurring within
their representative teams.
Team communications: Provide and encourage teams to share their practices and
guidance, which they and other teams can access through the corporate network.
Common tools used for this purpose include team wikis, OneNotes, or Markdown
sites.
Collaboration: Encourage informal team-to-team communications and
collaboration within the team. Institutionalizing practices such as code reviews,
design reviews, spec reviews not only increase team collaboration but help
develop individual and overall corporate competence.
Empower a productive workforce
Improve organizational culture


# Page 1414

You improve organizational effectiveness by attending to the culture you want to build.
Culture changes occur when individuals, teams, and organizations adopt one or more
continuous improvement practices. Several scalable Agile practices include:
Retrospectives: By asking questions such as: "What went well?", "What should we
do differently?", and "What should we stop doing?" help teams reflect on how they
can improve on their processes and practices. Retrospectives help teams surface
what is working well and what needs improvement. Retrospectives can be
conducted anytime and anywhere. However, institutionalizing certain
retrospectives at a regular cadence help institutionalize continuous improvement
practices. For example:
Sprint retrospectives can help teams identify areas to improve at a regular
cadence.
Release retrospectives can help organizations identify areas to improve
communications and internal practices and fuel improvement for the next
release.
Operational reviews: are typically held monthly and include representatives
from a whole value stream. Spanning a portfolio of projects and other initiatives
and using objective, quantitative data, design these retrospectives to provoke
discussions about the dynamics affecting performance between teams.
See the Agile Retrospective Resource Wiki
 for ideas, tips, and tools for
planning and conducting retrospectives. See also the Marketplace
Retrospectives extension
.
Improvement tracking board: Good ideas to improve processes can arise from any
one at any time. Capturing those ideas to discuss and decide on how to act on
them quickly is a key to support process improvement efforts.
A white board provides any easy and visual means with which to capture ideas.
Also, you can create an Improvement tracking team and capture ideas that you
track on an electronic board.
Institutionalize sharing: Sharing best practices and communicating ideas helps all
teams within an organization grow and improve. Developing a culture of learning
is key to supporting this and other continuous improvement activities. Some ideas
to consider:
In-house wikis
In-house distribution lists

Hackathon weeks or 10% hack time
Internal Agile support team to support teams who adopt Agile practices
The Culture Game
 provides a good resource for Agile managers to help
teams adopt Agile and share best practices.
Communities of practice: Support internal common disciplines (for example, DBAs,
SW Architects, UX design)
"Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months,
with a preference to the shorter timescale."
"Working software is the primary measure of progress."
- Agile manifesto
As the amount of software, features, and complexity increase, you'll need to adopt
practices that help you produce consumable solutions.
Feature flags: Use feature flags to enable or disable access to different features.
Provide support for turning on features to early adopters to get working feedback.
Release trains: Provide another type of cadence to deliver one or more features.
Feature teams understand the pre-planned schedule of pushing out new features,
and plan correctly. Release trains can correspond to the same sprint cadence
establish for the organization, or occur at a different cadence. See Scaled Agile
Framework for how to setup sprints and release trains.
Continuous integration: Adopt processes that eliminate manual work and instead
automate the flow of software through the test, build, and deploy cycles.
Internal Open Source: Bring the value and ethos that's developed in the Open
Source Software community to your internal development teams.
Along with the above practices, you'll find more guidance around scaling your Agile
tools in the following articles:

Scaling Agile to large teams
Agile manifesto
Agile Alliance
Scaled Agile Lean Development - The Principles
Estimating large initiatives: Part of waterfall project methods involved estimating
resources and schedules. The larger the initiatives, the less likely these estimates
were of any value. As projects grow, risks and unforeseen issues and impediments
can arise, invalidating many estimates.
Velocity: While team velocity can provide a useful metric for gaining insight into
how much work each team can complete during a sprint cycle, you can't add team
velocities to gain meaningful or useful metrics. Also, using velocity gained from
many teams to reliably complete long range forecasts is problematic. Teams vary in
the way they estimate their work, and those variations increase over time.
Top-down prescriptive solutions: One size doesn't fit all, and one solution typically
doesn't fit all teams. Supporting team autonomy means letting teams find their
own solutions.

Manage priorities and gain visibility
across teams
Article • 03/25/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Agile tools provide each team a wealth of ways to gain visibility into their work—to
manage priorities and status and to monitor progress and trends. However, how do you
gain visibility across several teams? What tools should you use?
You have three main ways to track progress across several teams.
Management teams can define Delivery Plans that provide visibility into the
deliverables several teams have scheduled
Each management team can use their Agile tools, and in particular portfolio
backlogs, to gain visibility of the feature teams defined under their area path
Management teams can create dashboards that monitor status, progress, and
trends across several teams.
For an overview of all team tools, see Manage teams and configure team tools.
With a Delivery Plan, you gain a tailor-made view across several teams and their
development backlogs—stories, features, or epics. You can use these views to drive
alignment across teams by overlaying several backlogs onto your delivery schedule.
When you configure a Delivery Plan, you select the teams and backlog levels of interest.
You can then interact with the plan to update it and drill into more details. For more
information about Delivery Plans, see Review team plans.
Delivery Plans support a view of team backlogs
on a calendar timeline


# Page 1418

The first level of gaining visibility across several teams is to configure your teams and
backlogs to support the views you want.
We recommend that you structure your teams as follows:
Add a management team for a group of feature teams; these teams own epics and
turn on only the Epic portfolio backlog level
Add feature teams to manage features, stories and tasks, and turn on the stories
and features backlog levels
The management team creates the epics. Then, they or their feature teams break down
the epics into features and then map their features to the epics on the management
backlog.
Limiting the backlog levels for each team—Epics for management teams and Features
and Stories for feature teams—helps each team to stay focused on monitoring the
progress of their work. For details on managing team backlog levels, see Select backlog
navigation levels.
Use portfolio backlogs to track features and
epics
 Tip
By breaking down large goals, epics, scenarios, or features into smaller ones, teams
can make better estimates and identify risks and dependencies.


# Page 1419

With the multi-team portfolio backlog view, you can:
Review priorities with your team and reorder features to support current priorities
You can drill down to see the status of each feature's child user stories or PBIs
Filter the backlog based on keyword or tag to focus on specific teams or
categorized items
(Optional) You can use the mapping feature to map user stories or PBIs to features
Management teams can drill down from their portfolio backlog to see how Epics are
progressing. Drilling down, you can see all the backlog items and features, even though
they belong to one of three different teams: Customer Service, Phone, and Web.
Items that are owned by other teams appear with an information icon, 
 .
View child items owned by other teams


# Page 1420

Feature teams can turn Show parents on their backlogs to see context and those items
owned by other teams.
Items that are owned by other teams appear with an information icon, 
 .
For more information about this configuration, see Portfolio management, Add teams,
and Organize your backlog.
 Tip
Add the Node Name field as a column to identify the area path/team associated
with the work items.
View backlog items and parent items owned by other
teams
 Tip
When estimating stories or product backlog items, start with one story point per
person per day. Feature teams can later calibrate and adjust those estimates as
needed. For example, the velocity of a seasoned team is higher than a new team.
The size of the work stays the same, but a seasoned team can just deliver faster.


# Page 1421

A second method for gaining visibility across teams is to define multi-team focused
dashboards that let you view progress, status, and trends. You do define focused
dashboards primarily by defining queries that either capture the progress of a single
team or several teams. You can then create charts and view trends for each team or for
several teams.
The two areas of most interest to management teams are project health and bug debt.
The widget catalog provides 10+ widgets you can add to a dashboard to track the
status, progress, and health of your project and teams. Also, you can find other widgets
in the Visual Studio Marketplace
, Azure DevOps tab.
For example, here we've added three query-based charts, one for each team, to a
dashboard that shows the active and resolved bugs over the previous four weeks.
Add management dashboards with multi-team
views


# Page 1422

When you define multi-team dashboards, consider the following questions:


# Page 1423

What are you wanting to learn and how will it drive your organization's actions?
What time frame is of interest?
Review Agile culture and Practices that scale for guidance on team autonomy and
organizational alignment.
Use the Query Results widget to provide a list of features by state:
Completed features (Done or Closed)
New features (New or Proposed)
Features being actively worked (In Progress or Active)
Use the Chart for work items widget to add query-based charts. For more information
about creating query-based charts, see Charts.
Another measure of project health and the health of the teams is to monitor bug activity
and bug debt. Consider the charts you can create that will help you answer these
questions:
Are bugs getting fixed? At a rate that's acceptable?
How stale are bugs?
Is the bug debt per team being maintained?
Is the ratio of high priority bugs being kept within organizational goals?
For tips on creating queries based on counts or numeric fields, see Query by numeric
field.
You can add Widgets based on the Analytics Service to a dashboard that show progress
for a team. From one dashboard, you can add widgets for any team within the project.
Project health and progress against goals dashboard
Technical debt, bug debt, and activity dashboard
Use the Analytics Service to gain visibility
across teams
Track capacity when working on more than one
team

You can track capacity for individuals that participate on more than one team. To learn
how, see Set sprint capacity, Track capacity when working on more than one team.
While the management teams you configure can use the board to monitor feature
progress by turning on the Features backlog, there are limitations inherent within these
views. Even if the management team and the feature teams configure their Feature
board columns with identical workflow mapping, updating the Features on one team's
board won't be reflected on another team's board. Only when the work item state
changes does the card column reflect the same on all boards.
As you can see, there are many ways you can monitor progress and trends across
several teams. The methods you choose depend on your focus and organizational goals.
Here are some other articles that address working with multiple teams:
Backlogs, boards, and plans
Review team plans
Add teams
Portfolio management
Limitations of multi-team board views
） Important
Work items that appear on more than one team's board can yield query results that
don't meet your expectations. Because each team can customize the board
columns and swimlanes, the values assigned to work items which appear on
different boards may not be the same. The primary work around for this issue is to
maintain single ownership of work items by team area path. Another option is to
add custom workflow states which all teams can use. For more information, see
Customize your work tracking experience.

When the Azure Boards connection to GitHub loses access, an alert status with a red-X
appears in the user interface. Hover over the alert to see that the credentials are no
longer valid. To fix the issue, remove the connection and create a new one.
To resolve this issue, consider the following items:
If the connection is using OAuth:
The Azure Boards application had its access denied for one of the repositories.
GitHub might be unavailable/unreachable. This unavailability could be because
of an outage in either service or an infrastructure/network issue on-premises.
You can check service status from the following links:
GitHub
Azure DevOps
Delete and recreate the connection to the GitHub repository. This recreated
connection causes GitHub to prompt to reauthorize Azure Boards.
If the connection is using a PAT:

# Page 1464

The PAT was revoked or the required permission scopes changed and are
insufficient.
The user might not have admin permissions on the GitHub repo.
Recreate the PAT and ensure the scope for the token includes the required
permissions: repo, read:user, user:email, admin:repo_hook . For more
information, see Best practices for using PATs.
If you migrated from Azure DevOps Server to Azure DevOps Services with an existing
GitHub Enterprise Server connection, your existing connection may not work as
expected. Work item mentions within GitHub might be delayed or never appear in Azure
DevOps Services because the callback URL associated with GitHub is no longer valid.
Consider the following resolutions:
Remove and re-create the connection: Remove and re-create the connection to
the GitHub Enterprise Server repository. Follow the sequence of steps provided in
Connect from Azure Boards documentation.
Fix the webhook URL: Go to GitHub's repository settings page and edit the
webhook URL, pointing to the migrated Azure DevOps organization URL:
https://dev.azure.com/{OrganizationName}/_apis/work/events?api-version=5.2-
preview
Connecting your GitHub repository to projects in multiple Azure DevOps organizations,
such as dev.azure.com/Contoso and dev.azure.com/Fabrikam, can cause unexpected
results with AB# mentions. Work item IDs aren't unique across Azure DevOps
organizations, so AB#12 could refer to a work item in either Contoso or Fabrikam. When
a work item is mentioned in a commit message or pull request, both organizations
might attempt to link to a work item with the matching ID, causing confusion.
To avoid this issue, connect a single GitHub repository to only one Azure DevOps
organization.

Link GitHub commits, pull requests,
branches, and issues to work items in
Azure Boards
Article • 10/02/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
In this article, learn how to link work items to GitHub commits, pull requests, and
branches after connecting your Azure Boards project with a GitHub repository. You can
use the #mention syntax for commits and branches or add a GitHub commit, pull
request, or branch link directly from the Azure Boards work item.
Project connection: Ensure your Azure Boards project is connected to the GitHub
repository where the commits, pull requests, and branch you want to link to/from
exist. For more information, see Azure Boards-GitHub integration.
Permissions: Be a Contributor to both the Azure Boards project and the GitHub
repository.
７ Note
With the Azure Boards app for GitHub, Azure Boards and Azure DevOps Services
integrate with GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise Server repositories. Azure
DevOps Server 2019 and later versions support integration with GitHub Enterprise
Server repositories only. Integration with other Git repositories is not supported.
Prerequisites
７ Note
Projects that use the Hosted XML process model require updates to the work item
types to view the Development section and GitHub link types. For more
information, see Update XML definitions for select work item types.
Use AB#  to link from GitHub to Azure Boards
work items


# Page 1469

From a GitHub commit, pull request or issue, use the following syntax to create a link to
your Azure Boards work item. Enter the AB#ID  within the text of a commit message. Or,
for a pull request or issue, enter the AB#ID  within the title or description. Using AB#ID  in
a comment doesn't create a link on the work item.
For example, AB#125  links to work item ID 125.
You can also enter a commit or pull request message to transition the work item. The
system recognizes fix , fixes , and fixed , and applies it to the #-mention item that
follows. Mentioned work items transition to the first State associated with the Resolved
workflow category state. If no State is associated with Resolved, the work item transitions
to the State associated with the Completed workflow category state. For more
information, see How workflow category states are used in Azure Boards backlogs and
boards.
Review the following table of examples:

When you add a link to a work item using AB#, those links appear in the Development
section of the pull request.
To create a GitHub branch directly from a work item, do these steps:
1. From your board, find the work item from which you want to create a GitHub
branch.
2. Select 
 Work item actions > New GitHub branch.
７ Note
If you connected the same GitHub repo to projects defined in two or more Azure
DevOps organizations, you might see unexpected AB# mention linking. For more
information, see Resolve connection issues. For this reason, we recommend that
you only connect a GitHub repo to projects defined in a single Azure DevOps
organization.

Add status badges for your GitHub repo
Article • 11/21/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
You can add Markdown syntax to a GitHub repo README.md  file to display your board
status in that repo. Show the status by adding the syntax you choose from your board
settings.
The syntax shown works whether you connected your project to a GitHub.com or your
GitHub Enterprise Server repository. For GitHub Enterprise Server, your server must be
network accessible to Azure DevOps Services.
Permissions: Be a team administrator for the team's settings you want to modify or
be a member of the Project Administrators group.
Integration with GitHub: Connect your project to the GitHub repository where the
commits and pull requests you want to link to/from exist.
Board configuration: Have a board you want to configure. When you add a team,
you add a board for that team. For more information, see About teams and Agile
tools.
Repository access: To add the status badge to the GitHub.com repository, be a
contributor of the repository.
1. Sign into Azure Boards and open your board.
2. Select the 
 gear icon to configure the board and set general team settings.
Prerequisites
Add a status badge


# Page 1478

3. Select Status badge and then check or uncheck the Allow anonymous users to
access the status badge. When it's unchecked, users who aren't signed in can still
view the status badge.

4. Choose the badge type you want and choose the 
 copy icon to copy the
Markdown syntax for the badge.
Show "In progress" columns only ignores the first and last columns.
Include all columns includes the first and last columns of the board.
You can customize the set of columns by specifying 2  for the columnOptions
and then a comma-delimited list of the board columns to appear. For
example, ?
columnOptions=2&columns=Proposed,Committed,In%20Progress,In%20Review , as
shown in the following syntax. For column labels that include spaces, you
must encode the space with %20 . For example, In%20Progress .
A badge similar to the following displays.
5. When you're done, select Save.
The only setting that you can configure is the Allow anonymous users to access
the status badge. The badge type under Settings only switches the Markdown
syntax for you to copy from the Sample Markdown and Image URL values.

Enable DevSecOps with Azure and
GitHub
Article • 11/28/2022
DevSecOps, sometimes called Secure DevOps, builds on the principles of DevOps
 but
puts security at the center of the entire application lifecycle. This concept is called “shift-
left security”: it moves security upstream from a production-only concern to encompass
the early stages of planning and development. Every team and person that works on an
application is required to consider security.
Microsoft and GitHub offer solutions to build confidence in the code that you run in
production. These solutions inspect your code and allow its traceability down to the
work items and insights on the third-party components that are in use.
Developers can use code scanning tools that quickly and automatically analyze the code
in a GitHub repository to find security vulnerabilities and coding errors.
You can scan code to find, triage, and prioritize fixes for existing problems. Code
scanning also prevents developers from introducing new problems. You can schedule
scans for specific days and times, or trigger scans when a specific event occurs in the
repository, such as a push. You can also track your repository's dependencies and
receive security alerts when GitHub detects vulnerable dependencies.
Scan your code with CodeQL and token scanning
Manage security advisories for your projects
Secure your code's dependencies with Dependabot
Teams can use Azure Boards web service to manage software projects. Azure Boards
provides a rich set of capabilities, including native support for Scrum and Kanban,
customizable dashboards, and integrated reporting.

Integrate Azure Pipelines and Kubernetes clusters with ease. You can use the same YAML
documents to build multi-stage pipelines-as-code for both continuous integration and
continuous delivery.
Azure Pipelines integrates metadata tracing into your container images, including
commit hashes and issue numbers from Azure Boards, so that you can inspect your
applications with confidence.
The ability to create deployment pipelines with YAML files and store them in source
control helps drive a tighter feedback loop between development and operation teams
who rely on clear, readable documents.

Developing a Kubernetes application can be challenging. You need Docker and
Kubernetes configuration files. You need to figure out how to test your application
locally and interact with other dependent services. You might need to develop and test
multiple services at once and with a team of developers.
Bridge to Kubernetes allows you to run and debug code on your development
computer, while still connected to your Kubernetes cluster with the rest of your
application or services. You can test your code end-to-end, hit breakpoints on code
running in the cluster, and share a development cluster between team members without
interference.

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
The Microsoft identity platform is an evolution of the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
developer platform. It allows developers to build applications that sign in all Microsoft
identities and get tokens to call Microsoft APIs, such as Microsoft Graph, or APIs that
developers have built.
Microsoft identity platform documentation
Azure AD B2C provides business-to-customer identity as a service. Your customers use
their preferred social, enterprise, or local account identities to get single sign-on access
to your applications and APIs.

Access management for cloud resources is a critical function for any organization that
uses the cloud. Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) helps you manage who
has access to Azure resources, what they can do with those resources, and what areas
they can access.
Learn about access management with Azure RBAC
You can use the Microsoft identity platform to authenticate with the rest of your DevOps
tools, including native support within Azure DevOps and integrations with GitHub
Enterprise.
Authenticate to GitHub Enterprise
Currently, an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster (specifically, the Kubernetes cloud
provider) requires an identity to create additional resources like load balancers and
managed disks in Azure. This identity can be either a managed identity or a service
principal. If you use a service principal, you must either provide one or AKS creates one
on your behalf. If you use managed identity, one will be created for you by AKS
automatically. For clusters that use service principals, the service principal must be
renewed eventually to keep the cluster working. Managing service principals adds
Manage identities and access with the
Microsoft identity platform

complexity, which is why it's easier to use managed identities instead. The same
permission requirements apply for both service principals and managed identities.
Managed identities are essentially a wrapper around service principals, and make their
management simpler.
Use managed identities in AKS
Azure Key Vault can be used to securely store and control access to tokens, passwords,
certificates, API keys, and other secrets. Centralizing storage of application secrets in Key
Vault allows you to control their distribution. Key Vault greatly reduces the chances that
secrets may be accidentally leaked. When you use Key Vault, application developers no
longer need to store security information in their application, which eliminates the need
to make this information part of the code. For example, an application may need to
connect to a database. Instead of storing the connection string in the app's code, you
can store it securely in Key Vault.
Store certificates, keys, and secrets with Azure Key Vault
With Azure Monitor, you can monitor both your application and infrastructure in real-
time, identifying issues with your code and potential suspicious activities and anomalies.
Azure Monitor integrates with release pipelines in Azure Pipelines to enable automatic
approval of quality gates or release rollback based on monitoring data.

Insights and Azure Monitor.

Security is one of the most important aspects of any architecture. Security provides
confidentiality, integrity, and availability assurances against deliberate attacks and abuse
of your valuable data and systems. Losing these assurances can negatively impact your

Use the Dependency Tracker extension
Article • 11/18/2024
Azure DevOps Services
The Dependency Tracker extension helps you manage dependencies across teams,
projects, and organizations. It provides filterable views to show all dependencies a team
is consuming and producing. These views allow you to track the state and schedule of
dependencies to support you in assessing the risk of dependencies to product
deliverables.
Use the Dependency Tracker to plan dependencies at the beginning of an iteration or
release, and to track the status during development. For any given dependency, the
following parties are involved:
Consumer: Feature team that has a need and starts a request for work.
Producer: Feature team that makes a commitment to deliver work.
Each work request and work deliverable is defined as a work item. The work items get
linked by the Successor-Predecessor link type or other directional link type. For more
information, see Link type reference Producing for/Consuming from link.
From the Dependency Tracker, you can choose different views and filters, and drill down
to obtain specific details. These views and options are described in the following
sections:
７ Note
We recommend that you use Delivery Plans to track dependencies instead of
Dependency Tracker. The Dependency Tracker extension is not a supported feature
of Azure Boards and isn't supported by any product team. For questions,
suggestions, or issues you have when using the extension, visit the Marketplace for
Azure DevOps, Dependency Tracker extension
 page. The Dependency Tracker
extension is only available on Azure DevOps Services.
 Tip
While any work item type can participate in dependency tracking, you might want
to limit dependencies to specific types, such as Features, Epics, User Stories, or
Bugs. You can create the restriction by configuring Dependency Tracker.


# Page 1492

Dependencies that other teams have on work your team is delivering.
All teams across organizations can participate in tracking dependencies.
Dependency: Work that Team A requires from Team B to do the work Team A is
trying to do.
Consumer: The team that asks to have work done.
The consumer owns the engagement and tracking of that work – since it's the
work their scenario requires, the burden is on the consumer to file, monitor, and
track the status of the work
The consumer owns entering the work into Azure Boards and submitting that
work request to the producer
The consumer is in charge of managing the work they requested so that they're
aware of any material changes and adjustments
Producer: The team that is doing the work.
Once the work gets submitted to the producer, the producer owns the work
item,
The producer is responsible for maintaining the work item in Azure Boards
Recommended use and key terms
７ Note
Dependency Tracker doesn't replace the in-person interactions that are required to
agree to doing the work. It provides easier planning and tracking capabilities.
Dependencies should be agreed upon by all parties before they enter into the
Dependency Tracker.
Key terms


# Page 1493

The producer owns the state of the work item and iteration
The consumer shouldn't touch these values once the work item gets handed
off
Sequencing: A producing team's work is needed before the consuming team can
start their work.
Tools: Install the Dependency Tracker extension
 for the organization for which
you want to track dependencies.
Permissions:
To view dependencies, be a member of the Project Valid Users group for the
project.
To create a dependency, be a member of the Contributors group for both
projects that participate in the dependency linking.
To modify configuration, be a member of the Project Collection Administrators
Group.
Authentication: To support cross-organization participation, all organizations must
authenticate users through the same Microsoft Entra ID.
Services: Enable Azure Boards as a service.
Configuration and customization tasks:
Set up the area paths and teams to participate in dependency tracking.
Configure iteration paths/sprints for the project and assign them to work items
participating in dependency tracking. This task is essential for the Timeline view
to yield meaningful data.
Customize your process as needed to support any other work items or fields.
Configure the Dependency Tracker to support your business needs and address
any customizations.
1. Open the web portal for the project where your team is defined.
Prerequisites
） Important
The default configuration for Dependency Tracker supports the Agile process. If
your project(s) are based on a different process or you have customized your
process, you may need to modify the configuration. See Configure the
Dependency Tracker later in this article.
Open the Dependency Tracker extension


# Page 1494

2. Select Boards > Dependency Tracker.
3. Choose the Area that corresponds to the team you want to view dependencies for
from the dropdown menu.
You can only filter on those Area paths defined for the project.


# Page 1495

Filter each supported view by entering a keyword or using one or more of the fields.
Provided fields include State, Work item type, and Iteration Path. Based on the keyword
that you enter, the filter function lists work items based on any displayed column field.
To show the filter toolbar, choose the 
 filter icon.
Toggle filters on and off by choosing the filter icon. To see more filters use the arrows at
the end of the list of filters.
Choose one or more values from the drop-down menu for each field. These fields
populate with the following values:
Work item type: Check one or more check boxes for the Work item types you want
to view. Work item types configured to participate in dependency tracking. The
default work item types are: Epic, Feature, User Story, and Bug. To modify the
configuration, see Configuration of Dependency Tracker.
State: Check one or more check boxes for the work item states you want to view.
The drop-down list should include all workflow States defined for all work item
types shown in the selected view.
Iteration: Check one or more check boxes for the Iteration Paths you want to view.
The drop-down list should include all Iteration Paths configured for the project and
for which there are work items listed in the current view.
Priority: Check one or more check boxes for the Priorities you want to view. The
priority values assigned to work items
Partner: The partner organization for which the work item is defined.
Your filtering options are dependent on the configuration defined for the Dependency
Tracker and that correspond to work items shown in the selected view that meet the
filter criteria. For example, if you don't have any work items assigned to Sprint 4, then
the Sprint 4 option doesn't appear in the filter options for the Iteration Path.
You can drop dependencies within the selected area, which excludes dependencies
inside your team.
Filter options
View drill-down options


# Page 1496

Several views provide interactive visualizations through drill-downs. These features are
addressed in the tabbed views descriptions later in this article.
A dependency represents work where one team is dependent on another team. Both
teams should track their own work in their own area path. By linking the work that is
dependent on the other teams work, the dependencies can be visualized and tracked.
1. Select New Dependency.
If the partner team is in a different organization, then first choose the Partner
Account. The Partner Account option can be enabled or disabled by configuring
the Dependency Tracker.
Create a dependency


# Page 1497

2. Search for work items by ID or enter a keyword contained within the work item
title. In the following example, we link a user story and a bug.
The Producer is the team that commits to delivering the work.
The Consumer is the team that needs or is dependent on the work.
The fastest way to create a dependency link is to type the Producer and
Consumer work item IDs in the search boxes and then choose Save.
Optionally, you can choose Create New to add work items that you then link as
dependent upon each other. Here we create two new features and link them.


# Page 1498

If no work items exist for one half of the dependency, you can create a new work
item as needed.
3. Select Save. The Save button is available only after two work items get chosen to
link.
4. From the success confirmation dialog, select View dependency.
The work items that you linked are highlighted.
In the following example, the Fabrikam Fiber/Service Delivery/Voice team is
dependent on the MyFirstProject team to deliver their User Story 706: Cancel
order form  to complete Bug 390: Cancel order form .


# Page 1499

You can also link work items using the Links tab to create Successor/Predecessor links. A
Predecessor is the producer of the work item, or the item that must come first. A
Successor is the consumer of the work item, or the item that is dependent on the first
item.
Create links manually
７ Note


# Page 1500

You can remove a dependency by choosing the 
 actions icon from the linked work
item and choose Remove Dependency Link option from the menu.
Optionally, you can remove the link from the work item's Links tab.
To open a set of dependent work items, select them in the same way you would via a
bulk edit, choose the 
 actions icon from one of the selected linked work items and
choose Open in Query option from the menu.
A new tab opens to the Query Results page.
The Successor/Predecessor (consumes/produces) link types are the default link
types used by the Dependency Tracker. If you customized your projects using a
Hosted XML process model, it's possible to specify different link types in the
Dependency Tracker configuration. For more information, see Configure the
Dependency Tracker later in this article, and Link user stories, issues, bugs, and
other work items.
Remove dependency links
Create a query of dependencies


# Page 1501

You can also create a custom query by selecting the Work items and direct links query
type and choose any work item type.
Choose Copy to HTML to copy the selected work items to the clipboard as a formatted
table.
The Consuming Dependencies view shows work that a team is dependent upon by
other teams or area paths.
Each column on the bar chart represents another area path that is producing
dependencies by workflow state for the selected Area View. The table shows the
number of unique dependencies. It also lists all work items participating in the filtered
view of tracked dependencies.
Within the table, you can complete the following actions.
Filter the list of work items by choosing one of the area path bars and progress
states in the bar chart graph
Expand or collapse the list of work items to show the full list of dependent work
items using the  expand and  collapse icons
Consuming Dependencies view


# Page 1502

Add or remove column fields by opening Column Options
Switch the sequence of work items by choosing the Display: Consumer on top or
Producer on top
The Producing Dependencies view shows work that other teams or area paths are
dependent on per the selected area.
Each column on the bar chart represents another area path that is consuming
dependencies by workflow state for the selected Area View. The table shows the
number of unique dependencies and lists all work items included in the filtered view of
tracked dependencies.
Within the table, you can complete the same actions as in the Consuming Dependencies
view.
The Timeline tab provides a calendar view of dependencies. The Timeline view is in Beta.
Producing Dependencies view
Timeline tab


# Page 1503

There are two versions of the Timeline view: Correct Flow and Incorrect Flow. Each
version shows the color-coded workflow state. You can customize color codes within the
Dependency Tracker configuration.
The Correct Flow view shows those dependencies that are in the correct sequence.
Successor work items get completed after their predecessor work item.
The Incorrect Flow view shows those dependencies that are out of order. At least one
predecessor work item gets completed after its successor work item.
The Risk Graph provides a visualization of how dependencies flow from Consumer team
to Producer team, or from Producer to Consumer. The graph lets a team understand the
number of dependencies and level of risks associated at a glance. Also, the risk graph
view demonstrates the value of linking dependencies and laddering them up to Stories.
） Important
For the Timeline to show meaningful data, have assigned the dependent work
items to Iteration Paths, and the Iteration Paths must have start and end dates
assigned.
Correct Flow view

# Page 1504

There are two views: Consuming From and Producing For. The workflow state color
coding is configurable. The width of the lines indicates how many dependencies exist in
that area, the thicker the link the more dependencies as indicated in the legend.

Be a member of the Project Collection Administrator Group to modify the configuration.
All changes to the configuration apply to all projects defined in the organization.
To change the configuration, choose the 
 gear icon and modify the syntax listed.
Choose Save when you're done.
The main properties you can modify are summarized as follows:
The link types to use to create dependency links. Defaults are the
Successor/Predecessor link types. Only customize when you use the Hosted XML
process model to customize work tracking.
Work items and work item types
Work item types to participate in dependency tracking
Mapping of work item category states to colors

Use the Azure Boards app with Slack to
manage work items
Article • 11/21/2024
Azure DevOps Services
If you use Slack
, you can use the Azure Boards app for Slack
 to create work items
and monitor work item activity in your Azure Boards project from your Slack channel.
The Azure Boards app for Slack allows users to set up and manage subscriptions in their
Slack channel. They can manage subscriptions for create, update, and other work item
events. Users can also get notifications for these events in their Slack channel.
Conversations in the Slack channel can be used to create work items. Previews for work
item URLs help users to start discussions around work.
Access levels: To create a work item, be a Contributor for the project.
７ Note
Azure Boards and Slack integration is only supported for Azure DevOps
Services.
Notifications are currently not supported inside direct messages.
Prerequisites


# Page 1520

Permissions: To create subscriptions in a Slack channel for work item events, be a
member of the Project Administrators group or Team Administrators group.
Policies: To receive notifications, enable the Third party application access via
OAuth policy for the organization.
1. To install the Azure Boards app to your Slack workspace, open a web browser, sign
into Slack, and open the Azure Boards app
.
2. Once added, a welcome message displays from the app as shown in the following
image.
3. Use the /azboards  Slack handle to interact with the app. A list of commands is
provided later in this article, Command reference.
To use the app, you must first link your Azure Boards project to your Slack channel.
1. Once the app gets installed in your Slack workspace, connect and authenticate
yourself to Azure Boards.
2. After signing in, use the following slash command inside a Slack channel to link to
the Azure Boards project that you specify with the URL:
Add the Azure Boards app to your Slack
workspace
Link your Azure Boards project to the Azure
Boards app


# Page 1521

For example:
Once the project is linked, you can create work items using /azboards create  command
or use message actions.
You can create subscriptions to monitor work items at any time using the /azboards
subscriptions  command. You have an option of setting up subscriptions just after
linking a project.
1. Select area path you want, the event that you're interested in, and use the
associated filters to customize your Slack channel. To easily set up subscriptions,
your recently accessed area paths are shown in the area path dropdown.
In case your team's area path doesn't appear in the Area path dropdown menu,
follow the instructions mentioned in the next section, Add area paths. Area paths
added using the /azboards addAreapath  command and area paths for which
subscriptions are created in the Slack channel always appear in the Area path
dropdown along with recently accessed area paths.
 /azboards link [project url]
 /azboards link https://dev.azure.com/myorg/myproject
Set up subscriptions to monitor work items


# Page 1522

You can add areas that your team works on to the channel so that they're always
available for creating work items and subscriptions. This action is important mainly for
the teams with more than 100 area paths.
Use the following command to add area paths from your project to the Slack
channel.
For example:
If you choose project name as your area path, then you receive notifications for all
the area paths in the project. It's logically equivalent to choosing 'Any' area path.
1. With the Azure Boards app, you can create work items from your channel. The app
supports custom work items as well.
To create a work item, use /azboards create .
Add area paths
  /azboards addAreapath [area path]
  /azboards addAreapath myproject\fabrikam
Create a work item with a command


# Page 1523

2. You can create work items directly from a command by passing work item type
and title as parameters. Work items get created only if they don't have any fields to
be mandatorily filled.
For example:
Often, discussions in a channel call for creation of work items. You can use message
actions to create a work item. The selected message is prefilled in the description
section of the work item. A link back to the conversation in the channel is stored in the
Discussion section of the newly created work item, giving users access to the discussion
that led to the creation of the work item.
 /azboards create [work item type] [work item title]
 /azboards create 'user story' Push cloud monitoring alerts to mobile 
devices
Create a work item from message actions


# Page 1524

To create work items using message actions
1. To view, add and remove subscriptions for a channel, use the /azboards
subscriptions  command:
This command lists all the current subscriptions for the channel and allows you to
add new subscriptions and remove existing ones. As part of adding subscriptions,
you can also customize what you get notified on by using various filters.

[!NOTE]Team administrators aren't able to remove or modify subscriptions created by
Project administrators.
To support collaboration around work items discussed within a channel, a preview of
work items referenced in the channel is displayed. When a user pastes the work item
URL, a preview is shown similar to the following image. This preview helps to keep work-
item-related conversations relevant and correct.
For this feature to work, users have to be signed-in. Once they're signed in, this feature
works for all channels in a workspace.

Unlink a project from a channel


# Page 1526

A Slack channel can only link to one Azure Boards project at a time. To link to a different
project, you must first unlink the current project using /azboards unlink  command.
Unlinking a project deletes all the subscriptions along with added area paths from the
channel. If the channel has no subscriptions, any user can unlink a project. However if a
channel has subscriptions, only project admins can unlink a project from a channel.
The following table lists all the /azboards  commands you can use in your Slack channel.

Storyboarding is deprecated.
Prerequisites


# Page 1546

For information about compatibility requirements, see Azure DevOps client
compatibility.
When you add or update work items from Excel, local copies of your work items are
created. To keep data in sync, refresh your local file when you open it and publish and
refresh frequently during a long online session.
At first, the data in the local document matches the data in the database. But you or
other team members can change the data about work items and cause the two to differ.
To view the most recent changes from the database, refresh the document. The refresh
downloads the latest values in the data store to your local document. To write changes
from the document to the database, publish the changes. Publishing uploads the
changes you made to the work item tracking data store.
To keep work items in sync from your local data store and Azure Boards, publish and
refresh often.
To work in Excel, see Bulk add work items with Excel.
） Important
You might receive the following error if you install Microsoft Office 2010 on the
same computer as a previous version of Office.
Team Foundation Error, Interface not registered (Exception from HRESULT:
0x80040155)
You might resolve this error by repairing Office. Access the Repair option by
opening the Control Panel, choose Uninstall or change a program, open the
context menu for Office 2010, and then choose Change. For more information, see
Resolve Azure DevOps and Office integration issues.

To add or modify work items by using Excel, connect your worksheet to a project.
Establish this connection to bind the document to the Azure DevOps project to
exchange information.
You can start work from the web portal, Excel, or Visual Studio/Team Explorer. Your
worksheet is associated with either a list of work items or a work item query.
This connection method requires that you install Azure DevOps Open in Excel
. It
also requires Visual Studio 2017 or later version.
1. From your web browser, check that you selected the right project, choose
Boards > Queries, and then choose All.
2. Choose the query you want to open in Excel.
Connect an Azure DevOps project to Excel
７ Note
This section illustrates how to connect Excel to an Azure Boards project. The
steps to connect to PowerPoint are similar.
When you connect to Azure Boards in the cloud, the Team Project Collection
automatically gets selected, because there's only one collection associated
with your Azure DevOps Services organization. When you connect to Azure
Boards in an on-premises server, choose the Team Project Collection before
you choose the project.
Open query in Excel (web portal)


# Page 1548

3. From the Results tab, choose the 
 actions icon.
For more information, see Bulk add work items with Excel.
One advantage of working in Excel is that you can work offline and add or modify work
items. The following procedures show you how to disconnect an Excel work item list
from Azure Boards. You can then reconnect later to synchronize the document with the
work item database.
 Tip
You can use multiple worksheets within an Excel workbook to work with different
input or query lists. You can only connect to one project per workbook.
Work offline and reconnect to Azure Boards
７ Note
If the project that contains work items for your Excel document is moved to a
different organization or Azure DevOps Server instance, you must reconfigure the
server to which the document connects. For more information, see Connect Azure
DevOps project to Excel earlier in this article.
Disconnect a document file from the network


# Page 1549

To disconnect an Excel document file from the network:
1. Open the document that you want to change while you're offline.
2. Refresh the work item list to retrieve the latest information from the work item
database. In Excel, on the Team ribbon, in the Work Items group, choose Refresh.
3. Add to the work item list the columns for all fields that you want to modify. You
can't add columns when the work item list is disconnected from the server.
4. Disconnect your computer from the network, or save the work item list file and
copy it to another computer.
An error message might appear that tells you the Office program couldn't establish
a connection with an Azure DevOps Server.
5. Modify or update the work item list as needed.
You can't create most types of links between work items when the work item
document is disconnected from the system. The exceptions are parent-child links
in an Excel tree list.
To reconnect an Excel document file:
1. Reconnect your computer to the network, or copy the file to a computer that is
connected to Azure Boards.
2. If you changed the document offline, in Excel, on the Team ribbon, in the Work
Items group, choose Publish.
3. If you didn't change the document offline, in Excel, on the Team ribbon, in the
Work Items group, choose Refresh.
4. Resolve any data validation errors or conflicts that occur.
The following Marketplace extensions support integration between Azure DevOps and
Office products.

You can add, modify, publish, and refresh work items using any query type and list type.
Use a flat list to bulk add or modify several types of work items at once, such as
backlog items, tasks, bugs, or issues.
Use a tree list to bulk add or modify work items and their tree-topology links.
Follow these best practices:
Input list, flat list: Import a list of work items or create new work items without
hierarchy.
Input list, tree list: Complete top-down planning and import hierarchically linked
work items.
Query list, tree list: View and modify the hierarchy of link relationships of many
existing work items.
Query list, flat list: Bulk update a list of work items or create new work items
without hierarchy.
Query types:
None: Indicates an input list.
Query title: Indicates the list of work items is tied to the specified query.
Azure Boards supports three query types, indicated by icons next to each query:
Flat list of work items: Imported as a flat list query.
Work items and direct links: Imported as a flat list query.
Use list and query types
Query types


# Page 1553

Tree of work items: Imported as a tree list.
Direct links queries are imported as a flat list into Excel, as modifying multiple types of
links isn't supported in Excel.
You can bulk add a nested list of work items, such as a work breakdown structure or
hierarchical user stories. For example, you can add a nested list of tasks, subtasks, and
bugs, or link tasks to product backlog items.
List types:
Flat list: A simple list of work items with a single Title column. No link
management is supported.
Tree list: A hierarchical list of work items that supports creating and updating tree
topology links, such as Parent-Child links, between work items. These lists include
two or more Title columns.
Parent-child links or other tree topology link types support creating a hierarchical
backlog structure. The work item types that participate in the hierarchy differ with
different processes and are shown in the following images.
Tree lists


# Page 1554

Hierarchies
The following image shows the hierarchy for the Agile process backlog work item:
User Stories and tasks are used to track work.
Bugs track code defects.
Epics and features are used to group work under larger scenarios.
Each team can configure how they manage Bug work items at the same level as
User Story or Task work items. Use the Working with bugs setting. For more
information about using these work item types, see Agile process.
To import a hierarchical list, see Add or import a hierarchical list of work items later in
this article.
You can open any query you defined in Azure Boards in Excel, including queries under
My Queries and Shared Queries. However, if you plan to share the workbook with other
team members, use a Shared Query. Other team members can't access workbooks or
worksheets based on personal queries stored under your My Queries folder.
You can use most Excel features when you work with a list of work items.
Features:
Format a cell or apply conditional formatting to a cell or column
Agile process
My queries versus shared queries
Use Excel features


# Page 1555

Cut and paste from one cell to other cells
Cut and paste a single row
Sum a column or add other formulas
Fill down cells
Filter
Add multiple worksheets to your workbook
Each worksheet in Excel can contain a different input list or query. However, all
worksheets within the workbook must connect to the same project within an
organization or project collection.
The following features behave differently when working with a worksheet connected to
Azure Boards.
Each cell or column of cells corresponds to a work item field. Each field is
associated with a data type. You can't enter data into an Excel cell that doesn't
meet the data type and requirements for that field.
You can only insert a single row at a time within the worksheet.
You can copy and paste multiple rows within the worksheet.
To move a work item within a hierarchy, cut the entire row and paste it under the
work item you want as its parent.
Use Outdent and Indent to change the location of a work item within the tree.
Undo (Ctrl Z) might not work. If you do something that you want to revert, you can
refresh the worksheet.
We recommend you publish and refresh your worksheet often to make sure your local
work remains in sync with Azure Boards data store. For more information about Excel,
see Basic Excel tasks
 .
You can sort work item flat lists using the Excel sort feature
. But, if you're working
from a tree list, you don't want to do any type of sort. Doing so changes the tree
structure and as such, the links between work items.
If you want to use Excel to manage the order of your work items as they appear in a
team backlog, you can do that by using the Stack Rank or Backlog Priority field (Agile or
Scrum process). You can set values in these fields, publish your worksheet, and refresh
your backlog. Your backlog items should appear reordered based on lowest to highest
number. However, the next time the backlog is reordered from the backlog, the values
you entered are subject to change.
Sort work items


# Page 1556

To maintain a specific order of work items, consider adding a custom field to manage
the sort order. You can then use this field within Excel to sort your flat list of work items.
This option doesn't change the order in which work items appear in your backlog.
You can and can't do the following tasks from an Excel worksheet:
Can do:
Add tags and bulk update work items with tags as described in Add work item tags
to categorize and filter lists and boards. Add the Tags field to your worksheet. Add
multiple tags separated by a semicolon (;).
Add simple text to a rich-text field, but if you're updating several work items in
bulk, you might lose formatting in existing work items.
Work offline and then reconnect and publish your changes. For more information,
see Connect Azure Boards to an Office client, Work offline, and reconnect.
Can't do:
Delete work items
Change the work item type of an existing work item
Move work items to another project
Import or update test case steps or other test artifacts
Add work items in any other State than the new State
Add to a work item discussion thread
Link to a remote work item.
1. Open Excel and connect to your Azure Boards project. Use one of the four
methods provided in Connect Azure DevOps project to Excel.
Tasks you can and can't do with Excel
Import work items as a flat list
７ Note
When you connect to Azure Boards in the cloud, the Team Project Collection
is automatically selected as there is only one collection associated with your
Azure DevOps Services organization. When you connect to Azure Boards in an
on-premises server, you choose the Team Project Collection prior to choosing
the project.


# Page 1557

2. In Excel, start with a blank worksheet. If you don't see the Team ribbon (or the
Team menu if you use Excel 2007), ensure that you installed the Azure DevOps
Office Integration 2019 tool
. For more information, see Azure DevOps Office
integration issues.
3. Choose New List from the Team ribbon.
4. From the New List dialog, choose Input list.
5. Your worksheet is now bound to your project as an input list (Query[None]), flat
list.
6. Specify the titles of the work items you want to add and their work item type.

The State and Reason fields automatically populate with default values once your
select the work item type.
7. Publish your worksheet.
Make sure your cursor is in a cell that contains data. Otherwise, the Publish button
might appear disabled.
You work items now have ID numbers.
8. To assign values to other fields, open Choose Columns, add the fields, make the
assignments, and publish your changes.
 Tip
When you add work items to a team backlog, ensure you specify the team's
Area Path and Iteration Path. If you need to add Area Paths or Iteration Paths,


# Page 1559

9. To open a work item to add more information, Choose the work item you want to
open and then choose Open in Web Access. Before you do, make sure you publish
any changes you made.
A web browser opens and displays the work item. If you make changes to the work
item, immediately refresh your worksheet to capture the changes.
You can add a hierarchy of work items linked using parent-child links or other tree
topology link type.
1. Starting from Step 5 from the previous procedure, convert your flat list, input list
into a tree list. Choose a cell within the flat list and then select Add Tree Level.
select Edit Areas and Iterations. This link opens the Project settings page in a
web browser. For more information, see Define area paths and assign to a
team and Define Iteration Paths and configure team iterations.
Import work items as a tree list
） Important
Avoid sorting a tree list, as it can alter the hierarchical link relationships.


# Page 1560

If the Add Tree Level is disabled, you're working from a query list. To convert your
list to a tree list, you must first reconfigure your list to an input list.
2. Choose the link type to use when you're adding work items to a hierarchy, and
then select Convert. The most usual choice is Parent-Child. You can only select
from tree topology link types. For more information, see Link type topologies and
restrictions.
The List type changes to Tree and a second Title column appears.
3. To add more levels to the hierarchy, select Add Tree Level again. For example, if
you want to add a hierarchy of Epics, Features, and User Stories, you want to have
Title 1, Title 2, and Title 3 columns.
If you want to add tasks, add another tree level to have four title columns. To
remove a column, see Remove a tree level.
4. Save your Excel file.
5. Enter the Work Item Type and Titles for the hierarchy you want to import. The
State fields automatically fill in with default values once you select the work item
type.


# Page 1561

6. Publish your worksheet.
Make sure your cursor is in a cell that contains data. Otherwise, the Publish button
might appear disabled.
IDs are now assigned to your work items. In the background, the link type you
selected is used to link each work item in the hierarchy. Epics are linked to
Features. Features are linked to User Stories.
7. To check the links made, choose a work item and choose Links and Attachments.
For example, here we show the Child and Parent links created for a Feature that
was imported.


# Page 1562

8. To enter a row under a work item where you want to add a child, choose the row
and then choose Add Child.
9. To assign values to other fields, open Choose Columns, add the fields, make the
assignments, and publish your changes.
10. To change the hierarchy, cut and paste the entire row of a work item to place it
under the new parent. When you publish the change, the old hierarchical links are
deleted, and the new hierarchical links are created.
You can use the 
 or 
 indent/outdent icons to demote or promote a
work item within the tree hierarchy. Ensure the header at the top of the column reads
Title n; if it doesn't, add a tree level.
1. First, publish changes that you made to work items before you remove a tree level.
Removing a tree level requires a refresh, which overwrites data in the work item
list. You lose any data you didn't publish.
Remove a tree level


# Page 1563

2. Next, delete any content under the tree-level Title number column you want to
remove—the highest numbered column—. This column should be the highest
numbered column in the tree.
3. Refresh your worksheet. The column containing empty values for the Title is
removed.
You get an error message if you attempt to delete the column.
Excel uses the data in the Title columns to determine the pattern of links between work
items. When you publish changes, any of the following conditions can result in an error,
an invalid link, or a tree link being created between incorrect work items:
A row between the work items is blank within the hierarchy.
The title of a work item is in the wrong column. Ensure you enter a title for each
child work item.
Multiple Title columns contain data within a row. Enter text in only one of the title
columns per row.
The list was sorted. Avoid sorting a tree list, as it can change the hierarchical link
relationships. If you do sort a tree list, recover by immediately refreshing.
To resolve an error, see Resolve invalid links.
Additionally, a parent-child linked work item can only have one parent. You can't add
the same work item task to two backlog items. Instead, define distinct work item tasks.
The easiest way to bulk update multiple work items is to create a query for the work
items you want to update, and then open that query in Excel.
Tips for working with a tree list
Update work items in bulk with a query list
 Tip
Keep your work in sync with these tips:
Use 
 (Refresh) when you first open a saved worksheet to download the
latest data from the data store.
Add columns to the worksheet using 
 (Choose Columns) to enter data for
additional fields.


# Page 1564

1. From the web portal or Visual Studio, create the work item query that contains the
work items you want to update. For more information, see Create and save
managed queries with the query editor.
2. Open Excel and connect to your Azure Boards project. Use one of the four
methods provided in Connect Azure DevOps project to Excel.
3. If you opened your query from the web portal or Visual Studio, you're done. Make
any changes you want. Open Choose Columns, add fields, make assignments, and
publish your changes.
4. If you start from Excel, open a blank worksheet. You can add a worksheet to an
existing workbook, as long as you're choosing a query from the same project the
workbook is bound to.
5. Choose New List from the Team ribbon.
6. From the New List dialog, choose Query list, and select the query you want from
the drop-down menu.
Publish your additions and modifications often to avoid data conflicts.
Save your workbook periodically to prevent data loss before you publish or
refresh.


# Page 1565

The icon next to each query indicates the query type. The first two query types, Flat
list of work items and Work items and direct links are imported as flat list queries.
Only the Tree of work items queries import as a tree list.
7. With the work items imported to Excel, make the modifications you want and
publish your changes.
If you're working with a tree list, see also the information provided in Import a
hierarchical list of work items.
If the Tree group commands aren't available, your worksheet is configured as a flat or
query list. To enable the Tree group commands, convert the list to either an input list or
a list based on a tree query. For more information, see the next section on Change your
list type or query.
You can change the work items listed in your worksheet. Specifically, you can:
Change your flat list to a tree list
Change from a query list to an input list
Change from an input list to a query list
Enable Tree commands
Change your list type or query


# Page 1566

Change the query your worksheet references
You can change your flat list to a tree list. However, if your list is a query list, you need to
reconfigure it first. If the Tree group commands are disabled, it indicates a flat or query
list.
To convert your query list to an input list, follow these steps.
1. Publish your changes.
2. On the Team ribbon, choose Configure, List.
3. Choose Refresh work items only and then Apply.
This choice changes the query list to an input list.
4. To convert from an input list to a query list, choose Refresh from query, select the
query, and then Apply.


# Page 1567

If you're working from a query, modify your query to contain the work items you want.
Then refresh your list. The other work items appear in your list.
If you're working with an input list, complete these steps.
1. From the Team ribbon, choose Get Work Items.
2. Choose the method you want from the three options available.
Add existing work items to your worksheet


# Page 1568

If the work items are defined in another project, then first select the Project. Then,
make your selections:
Query. Use this method when you defined a query that contains the set or
superset of work items you want.
IDs. Use this method when you know the IDs of the work items that you want
to link to. In the IDs box, type the IDs of the work items that you want to find,
separated by commas or spaces.
Title contains. Use this method to find work items that have a common word
or phrase in the title field. In the and type list, select the type of work item
that you want to retrieve.
3. Choose Find.
Only those work items defined for the selected project and specified work item
type are listed. To sort on a column field, choose the column Title.
７ Note
To minimize the time required to run the query, narrow the filter criteria of the
search.


# Page 1569

4. In the list of returned work items, select the check-box of one or more work items.
Select each work item that should link to the current work item. You can also
press the SHIFT key while selecting to choose a range of work items, or press
the CTRL key while selecting to choose multiple work items.
Choose Select All to select all work items in the list.
If you start your worksheet with a New List, you see only a set of default field columns.
You can add columns using the Choose Columns on the Team ribbon.
If you start your worksheet from an existing query, you see all the column fields defined
for the query. From there, you can add columns using the Choose Columns. However,
your additions don't modify the underlying query.
1. To assign values to other fields, choose Column Options to add the fields of
interest.
To filter the fields based on work item type, select the Work item type.
To move or remove a field, choose the field and then select the > or < icons.
Add or remove column fields


# Page 1570

To change the field sequence, move the field up or down in the list using the
up and down arrows.
You can add a rich-text field, such as the Description field, however you
might lose some of the formatting upon publish.
2. Once the fields appear in the worksheet, assign values and publish your updates.
When working with identity fields, ones that accept user accounts, see the next
section, Select user accounts.
3. Save your worksheet.
Use the Select User feature to find user accounts and assign values to person-named
fields. This feature also provides access to the most recently used (MRU) values. If your
team has hundreds or thousands of user accounts, this feature is especially useful.
1. If you don't have the latest version of Visual Studio (2015.1 or later version
, get it
now. You need the latest update to access the Select User feature.
2. Choose an identity or person-named field to activate the Select User feature in the
Team ribbon.
An identity or person-named field contains a user identity. These fields are typically
synchronized with a user account database, such as Microsoft Entra ID, Active
Directory, or a Workgroup.
3. Begin entering the name of the user account and the Assign User dialog
automatically filters the results until you can select the account of interest.
Select user accounts
 Tip
Without the Select User feature, you must enter user names exactly as they are in
the database, or you'll receive data validation errors when you try to publish.


# Page 1571

Enter a letter to jump to names starting with that letter. Only user names are
recognized; account aliases aren't. As you select user names, Excel remembers your
recent selections, allowing you to choose user accounts directly from the field.
You can complete many actions from the Links tab of the Links and Attachments dialog.
Specifically, you can:
Review the existing links defined for the selected work item
Add links to selected work items to one or more work items or select objects
Delete links
Open a linked work item (opens in the web portal)
Edit the link type of an existing link
Add columns to the Link list and sort on that list
For more information on linking work items, see Link user stories, issues, bugs, and
other work items.
You can't use the Links and Attachments dialog to bulk update work item links. To bulk
update tree-topology link types, use a tree list instead.
Link work items
View and add links


# Page 1572

1. To link a work item to other work items, choose the work item and then choose
Links and Attachments. From the Links tab, choose Link to and then choose the

To resolve publishing errors that might arise when you're working in Excel, see one of
the following articles:
Resolve data conflicts: A data conflict occurs when a field value is changed in Azure
Boards since the last time you published from Excel.
Resolve data validation errors: A data validation error occurs if a field value violates
the rules for that field and work item type.
Resolve invalid links in a tree hierarchy: An invalid link happens when a work item
in a hierarchy or tree list and is moved or sorted, breaking the dependencies
between work items. To resolve this error, review the error message and reposition
the work items to restore the correct structure.
Address Error TF208104: Hierarchical Link Relationship Is Locked:
If you receive error TF208104, your changes to the fields are published, but
changes to the link hierarchy aren't. This error occurs because another process
locks at least one of the link relationships for the work item, such as Project Server
integration.
） Important
You can create an Excel report using New Report only from an on-premises Azure
DevOps Server. These reports require your project's collection to be configured to
support SQL Server Analytics Server.

be published. In Excel, an invalid link occurs in a tree list of work items. It occurs if the
title of a work item title is missing or occurs in the wrong title column.
To update work items, be a member of the Contributors group or have your View work
items in this node and your Edit work items in this node permissions set to Allow. For
more information, see Change project-level permissions.
Error message TF208000: Duplicate titles
If you add a value to multiple Title columns of a work item, when you try to publish the
tree, the error message TF208000 appears in the Work Item Publishing Errors dialog
box. The error message specifies the row number of the invalid link.
1. Note the row number that appears in the dialog box.
2. Close the Work Item Publishing Errors dialog box.

4. Delete the duplicate title or titles so that only one title column has a value.
5. On the Team tab, in the Work Items group, choose Publish.
Error message TF208001: Child work item disconnected from parent
If you remove the title of a child work item, when you try to publish the work item list
the error message TF208001 appears in the Work Item Publishing Errors dialog box.
The error message specifies the row number of the invalid link. This error message also
appears if you create an invalid link structure by putting the title of a child work item
into the wrong column.
If you put a title in the wrong column, the resulting tree structure might be valid but not
match your intent. The system can't detect this problem, therefore, an error message
doesn't appear.
Resolve an orphaned work item
1. Note the row number that appears in the dialog box.
2. Close the Work Item Publishing Errors dialog box.
3. Find the row that the error message specified. The misplaced title might be in this
row, or it might be in the next row.
4. To fix the invalid link, move the title to the correct column.
5. On the Team tab, in the Work Items group, choose Publish.
Error message TF208017: Missing Title 1 in the first row
If the first work item in the list has no value in the Title 1 column, the error message
TF208017 appears in the Work Item Publishing Errors dialog box when you try to
publish the work item list.


# Page 1585

1. Close the Work Item Publishing Errors dialog box.
2. Determine why the first work item lacks a Title 1 value. The analysis of the cause of
the error determines what you must do to repair the work item list.
3. If the first work item should be at the top of the list, move its title value into the
Title 1 column.
4. If the first work item should be lower in the list, move the correct work item to the
top of the list. For more information about how to move work items, see Bulk add
work items with Excel.
5. On the Team tab, in the Work Items group, choose Publish.
Error message TF208022: Sorted tree list
If you didn't install Service Pack 1 for Visual Studio 2010 or later version, the following
error message appears when you choose Publish after you sort the work items in a tree
list:
TF208022: Can't publish a sorted tree list. Before you can publish, you must clear any
sort criteria applied to this work item list. The order of work items changed. Removing
sort criteria doesn't return the list to its original order. Verify that all of the parent-child
relationships in the tree are correct before you publish.
You can't publish your changes until you re-establish the tree hierarchy. You can resolve
this error either by discarding your changes and refreshing the list or by manually
restoring the hierarchy and then publishing the list.
Resolve sorted tree list issues
Choose Refresh to discard your changes and restore the tree hierarchy. If you refresh
the tree list, you remove all your changes other than the sort. To refresh the tree list, on
the Team tab, in the Work Items group, choose Refresh.
Manually restore the tree hierarchy by moving the row entries of child items under their
parent items. Then, on the Team tab, in the Work Items group, choose Publish.
Error message TF208102: Excel sort on a tree list
The following error message appears if you sort the work items in a tree list in Excel:
TF208102: You performed an Excel sort on a tree list. This action removed the modified
or newly introduced hierarchical link relationships of the tree. You can still publish the
changes you made to individual work items. After you publish, the list restores to
previous hierarchy. In general, you shouldn't sort a tree list whose hierarchy was
modified.|


# Page 1586

This message indicates that you can publish the changes that you made to the fields,
but all changes that you made to the link hierarchy were discarded. The tree hierarchy
automatically reverts to its original structure.
Publish changes and retrieve the tree hierarchy
1. On the Team tab, in the Work Items group, choose Publish.
2. Choose Refresh.
Error message TF208104: Hierarchical link Relationship is locked
If you publish a worksheet that contains work items that are synchronized with Project
Server and whose hierarchical link relationships are locked (
), the following error
message may appear:
TF208104: You modified one or more hierarchical link relationships that might be locked
by other processes, such as Project Server. Changes that you made to individual work
items were published. Changes that you made to locked links were autocorrected.
This error appears when you change the link hierarchy that contains locked links. This
message indicates that the changes that you made to the fields are published. All
changes you made to the link hierarchy, whether locked or not locked, aren't published
and were reverted to their original assignments.
To modify locked hierarchical, make your changes in the enterprise project plan mapped
to the project. For more information, see Manage project details.
To publish changes to links that aren't locked:
For work items that aren't synchronized, you can modify the hierarchical link relationship
from Team Explorer or the web portal. For more information, see Bulk add or modify
work items with Excel.
To modify unlocked hierarchical link relationships in Excel, revise the query that you use
to export the work items to exclude all work items with locked links. For example, you
can add a clause to the filter criteria to omit items whose Project Server Is Linked field is
set to Yes.
No. You can't delete work items from Excel. The only way to delete work items is from
the web portal or the az boards work-item delete  command-line tool. For more
information, see Move, change, or delete work items.
Can I delete work items from Excel?

Yes. Each worksheet in Excel can contain a different input list or query. However, all
worksheets within the workbook must connect to the same project within an
organization or project collection.
To bulk add or modify work items in a different project, open a new Excel workbook.
Yes. You can use many Excel features, such as cut, paste, automatic fill, format, sort (flat
list only), filter, and add formulas. You can cut and paste rows to resequence items
within a list and change link relationships among work items.
To drag a work item, select the work item or contiguous set of work items that you want
to move. Open the context menu and choose Select, Table Row, point to the border of
the selection, and—when the pointer becomes a move pointer 
—drag the row to
another location.

Resolve data conflicts when you publish
or refresh Excel data
Article • 07/12/2023
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
A data conflict occurs when you try to publish a work item from Excel and the version of
that work item differs from the version in the work item database. The following
example shows how two team members can create such a conflict.
1. A team member opens a copy of a work item in a work item list in Excel or Project.
2. Team member A edits the work item and makes one set of changes.
3. Team member B edits that same work item and makes a different set of changes,
and publishes those changes.
4. Team member A finishes editing the work item and tries to publish the changes to
the work item.
5. Excel or Project displays the Work Item Publishing Errors dialog box, which shows
items that it couldn't publish.
1. In the Work Item Publishing Errors dialog box, for each work item in the
Unpublished work items box that has Conflict in the Issue column, follow these
steps.
a. In the Unpublished work items box, select the work item.
The Details area shows a list of conflicts for the selected work item. The
Conflicting field column shows the name of the field in which the conflict
occurs. The Local version and Server version columns show the local and server
data, respectively, and a check box appears next to the data in each of these
columns.
b. For each row in the Details box, select the check box next to the correct value.
When you select the local version, the data in Office Excel or Office Project
overwrites the data on the server. If you select the server version, the server
data overwrites the data in Office Excel or Office Project.

Resolve data validation errors that occur
when you publish from Excel
Article • 07/12/2023
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
A data validation error occurs when a change in the work item list or project plan
violates a work item type's rule. The following examples show common data validation
errors:
Someone assigns a work item to a team member whose name isn't included in the
list of allowed values
Someone creates a work item but forgets to complete a required field, such as the
work item type.
If a data validation error occurs when you try to publish changes, the Work Item
Publishing Errors dialog box appears, and in the Unpublished work items list the
Issue column shows Validation error or another phrase that contains Invalid.
To update work items, be a member of the Contributors group or have your View work

About wikis, READMEs, and Markdown
Article • 03/25/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
To support your team or contributors to your project, use Markdown
 to add rich
formatting, tables, and images to your team project. You can use Markdown format
within a team project wiki, content you add to a dashboard, your team project README
file, or other repository README file.
Use your team project wiki to share information with other team members. When you
provision a wiki from scratch, a new Git repository stores your Markdown files, images,
attachments, and sequence of pages. This wiki supports collaborative editing of its
content and structure.
The following features are supported for the team project wiki.
Create a wiki for your team project
Publish code as wiki
Add and edit wiki pages
View wiki page history and revert
Clone and update wiki content offline

Table of contents (TOC) for wiki pages
Many teams document their code using Markdown and check in these files along with
the code. While Git supports the maintenance and review of such documentation along
with standard pull requests, such files present a few challenges to consumers of the
content.
Readers must often sift through many files and folders to find the content of
interest.
Content lacks organization and structure. There's no inherent page hierarchy to
support readers.
Content versioning isn't supported.
Searching through content relies on searching the codes rather than a search
experience optimized for searching content.
With the publish code as a wiki feature, you can publish one or more Git repositories
defined in your team project to a wiki. This feature provides a way to maintain your
content alongside your code base, and lets you selectively publish and update your
content to a wiki.
There are significant differences between how you manage the content for a wiki that
you provision for a team project versus wiki pages that you publish from a Git
repository. For details, see Publish a Git repo to a wiki.
Markdown makes it easy to format text and include images. You can also link to
documents within your project pages, README files, dashboards, and pull requests. You
can provide guidance to your team in the following places using Markdown:
Team project wiki
Publish code as wiki
Add Markdown to a dashboard
Project page or Welcome pages
Publish existing Git repositories to a wiki

Azure Boards FAQs
FAQ
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Find answers to frequently asked questions about using Azure Boards. For FAQs specific
to queries or Microsoft Excel integration to add or modify work items defined in Azure
DevOps, see Query FAQs and FAQs: Work in Excel connected to Azure Boards.
You can view a list of features that are on our roadmap for Azure Boards from the
Features Timeline. To request a feature or up-vote a feature, go to our Developer
Community page
.
As a member of an Azure Boards project, you can use most features to track work.
Limitations to select features are based on the access level and security group to which
a user is assigned. Other limitations can be imposed based on work tracking permissions
or custom rules. For more information, see Default permissions and access for Azure
Boards.
For private projects, you can grant access to an unlimited number of users by assigning
them Stakeholder access. For public projects, anonymous users—ones who don't sign
into the project—can view all work items. For more information, see Stakeholder access
quick reference and Make a private project public.
Also, if your organization uses Microsoft Entra ID to manage user access, you can add
external users to your organization.
You can restrict access by setting permissions for an area path. For more information,
see the following articles:

Yes. Conditional rules based on user or group membership get cached for your web
browser. If you find yourself restricted to update a work item, you probably encountered
one of these rules. For more information about conditional rules, see Rules and rule
evaluation. If your cache stores outdated rules, you can wait for the client cache to
expire within three days, or you can clear the cache.
To clear the cache, run the following command in the browser command window and
then refresh the browser: window.indexedDB.deleteDatabase("wit")
See Tools and clients that connect to Azure DevOps.
For an introduction to work items, see About work items.
To view all work items defined in a project, open a query and add two clauses:
Work Item Type = [Any]
State = [Any]
From there, you can add filters to refine the query. For more information, see Create and
save managed queries with the query editor.

Can a work item be assigned to several users or
a user group?


# Page 1605

No. Work items can only be assigned to a single user. Also, you can only add a user that
is available from the people picker.
The main method to group work is to assign it to the same area path. Area paths are
used to group work items by product, feature, or business areas and to support teams
responsible for work assigned to those areas. In addition, you can group work under a
parent work item using parent-child links, referred to as a hierarchical grouping.
For a discussion of these two usages and the tools they support, see Configuration and
customization of Azure Boards, Area paths, product teams, and portfolio management.
Milestone markers aren't used in Azure Boards work tracking, except for Delivery Plans.
Delivery Plans provide a calendar view and allow you to define a milestone marker. For
more information, see Review team Delivery Plans.
However, you can use one or more of the following options to mark a work item as a
milestone:
Prepend or append the word Milestone in the title of your work item
Add a work item tag labeled Milestone
Add a custom field labeled Milestone and populate it with a pick list of milestones
Link work items using the Predecessor/Successor or Related link type to a
milestone work item
Assign the milestone work item to the sprint in which it's targeted for completion.
You can track dependencies between work items by linking them using a related or
other link type. See Link work items to other objects.
You can view dependencies using Delivery Plans.
If you're tracking dependencies across one or more organizations, you might want to
use the Dependency Tracker.

Each process defines four default backlog levels: the iteration backlog, requirement
backlog, feature and epic portfolio backlogs. The work item types added to each
backlog level are the natural work item types to form parent-child relationship and
group work items into a hierarchy. For more information, see Organize your backlog,
map child work items to parents. To customize the process, see Customize your
backlogs or boards, Edit or rename the requirement backlog.
With Azure Boards (cloud service), you can choose to copy child work items when
copying a work item. For more information, see Copy or clone work items.
See Bulk modify work items, Bulk modify rich-text fields.
Yes, you can set your backlog level to include two different rules. The first rule it to set
the parent as active when any of its children are set to active. The second rule is to set
parent to resolved or closed when all the children are closed. These rules can be
configured for backlog level. For more information, see Automate work item state
transitions
Work items automatically change state after your team administrator set up automation
rules on the backlog. Create rules to automatically set the state to active or closed
depending on the state change of its children. For more information, see Automate
work item state transitions.

# Page 1607

Rules only trigger when the state of the child item moves from New to Active or into
Closed. Rules don't trigger when the state of the child item moves from Closed back to
Active. This is currently by design.
No, the rules are applied to all work item types in that backlog level. We use state
categories instead of states because state categories are consistent across all work item
types.
Yes, rules are configured per backlog level. Automation rules on the user stories backlog
don't affect features or epics. But, you can also set up rules separately for features and
epics. For more information, see Automate work item state transitions.
Rules only trigger if both the parent and children belong to the same team. We don’t
want rules automatically triggered for items that belong to other teams. For more
information, see Automate work item state transitions.

and iteration path assignments. Backlogs list work items, boards display work items as

cards. To understand how the filtering is applied, see About teams and Agile tools, Team
defaults referenced by backlogs and boards.
To add a backlog or board, you add a team. Each team is configured with its own set of
backlogs and boards as described in About teams and Agile tools. Each team can
customize these Agile tools.
Azure DevOps imposes limits such as the number of work items that display on a
backlog or board, numbers of teams you can define, and more. For a full list, see Work
tracking, process, and project limits.
See Azure Boards migration and integration.
Each backlog lists a filtered set of work items based on the team's selected area path,
iteration paths, and work item types.
Product backlog: By default lists User Stories (Agile), Issues (Basic), Product
Backlog Items and Bugs (Scrum), or Requirements (CMMI). Provides options to
show Parents, Forecast, and In Progress or Completed child items.
Portfolio backlog: By default lists Features (all process models) for the Features
backlog, and Epics (Agile, Scrum, and CMMI) for the Epic backlog. Provides options
to show Parents and In Progress or Completed child items.
Sprint backlog: By default lists all product backlog items assigned to the selected
iteration, regardless of status. Provides options to show Work details.
Yes. You can assign sprints to work items and filter your board based on the iteration
path. For more information, see Filter your board.

No. Task checklists only support the task work item type.
Azure DevOps doesn't provide a native view of the critical path. In part, as Agile
methodologies favor a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) over Critical Path Management
(CPM). By using MVP, you identify the shortest path and dependencies by prioritizing
epics, features, stories and tasks.
That said, we recommend that you use Delivery Plans to view dependencies and a
calendar view of work.

When you reorder, nest, and display work items, Azure Boards expects a natural
hierarchy. The natural hierarchy breaks when you create same-category or same-type
links between work items. For example, parent to child links that are bug to bug or user
story to user story or requirements category to task category. Use this article to address
error messages when you add links that aren't in the natural hierarchy.
You might see an error similar to one of the following messages:
You cannot reorder work items and some work items might not be shown
No work item IDs are listed
To address this error, do the following steps:
1. Open your backlog.
2. Review the list of items to identify those items of the same type that are nested.
Example #1: The following image shows a user story as a child of another
user story.
You cannot reorder work items and some work
items might not be shown


# Page 1616

Example #2: The following image shows a bug as a child of a user story.
When the backlog displays user stories and bugs at the same level
(Requirements category), it results in a nested item that disables the ordering
feature.
3. Remove any parent-child links that exist among nested items of the same work
item type or category, or consider changing the link type to Related.
4. Refresh your backlog.
These steps should resolve the issue, and the error message no longer displays.
You might see an error similar to one of the following messages:
You cannot reorder work items and some work items might not be shown. See
work item(s) 7 to either remove the parent to child link or change the link type
to Related.
Work item 3 can't be reordered because its parent is on the same category.
To address this error, do the following steps:
1. Open the work item listed in the error message.
2. Look for a parent or child link. Make sure this link goes to a work item in the same
category as the work item you opened. Look for a link that goes to another work
item that appears on the same backlog level as the work item you opened.
Depending on your team's bug behavior setting, bugs might appear with
requirements or tasks.
3. Remove the problem parent-child link. If you would like to keep these items
associated, use Related link type instead.
Work item can't be reordered because its
parent is on the same category


# Page 1617

The message no longer displays.
You might see an error similar to the following message:
Items added to the backlog might disappear on a refresh because your team project
marks them as "in progress". Those items appear when you change the "In
progress" filter to Show.
This message indicates that the In Progress filter for the backlog is turned off.
When you refresh your browser, the work items display based on your selected filters. To
reset the filters, do the following steps.
1. Open your backlog.
2. From the View options selector, choose to show or hide In Progress items.
Work items in progress might disappear on
refresh


# Page 1618

If you turn the In Progress control off, then items that are in the Active, Committed, or
Resolved states or states that map to the In Progress category state don't appear.
Hide In Progress items when you want to forecast work. For more information, see
Forecast your product backlog.
The following image shows the natural hierarchy for the Agile, Scrum, and Capability
Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) processes.
Do:
Maintain a flat list, rather than nesting requirements, bugs, and tasks.
Only create parent-child links one level deep between items that belong to a
different category. The category a work item belongs to gets determined by your
process levels and your team's selected bug behavior.
Use the feature work item type to group user stories (Agile), issues (Basic), work
items (Scrum), or requirements (CMMI). You can map work items to features. This
７ Note
For more information, see Configure your backlog view and Add custom
work item types.
For issues that might occur with multi-team ownership, see Exercising select
features with shared area paths.
To reorder work items on your backlog, have at least Basic access. If you have
Stakeholder access, you can't reorder work items. For more information, see
Stakeholder access quick reference.
Natural hierarchy for work item types
Best practices

mapping creates parent-child links in the background. For more information, see
Organize your backlog.
Don't:
Create a hierarchy of work items, tasks, and bugs.
Establish same-category hierarchies, such as parent-child links among work items
of the same type. For example, create story-story, bug-bug, task-task, or issue-
issue links. The backlog, board, and sprints experiences don't support reordering
for same-category hierarchies, because that approach introduces confusion by
ordering a work item that doesn't belong at that level.
Each team has the flexibility to choose to track bugs as requirements, tasks, or neither.
See the following guidelines:
If you track bugs as requirements: Nest them only under the Feature level.
If you track bugs as tasks: Nest them only under the Requirement level.
For more information, see Show bugs on backlogs and boards.
Track bugs as requirements or tasks
Display nested items on backlogs and boards


# Page 1620

Sprint backlogs and Taskboards exclusively display the last node in a same-category
hierarchy, which is referred to as the leaf node.
When tasks and bugs link to their parent requirements, they group them correctly on
the sprint backlog and Taskboard. When you establish parent-child links between a
requirement and a bug, and between the bug and a task, as demonstrated here, the task
appears on the sprint backlog and Taskboard, while the bug doesn't.

Use system fields or custom fields added to your project collection to enable meaningful
cross-project reports and queries. Any nonsystem field referenced in the workflow or
forms section of the work item type definition must have a FIELD element defined in the
FIELDS section of the work item type definition XML file. Specify any nonsystem field
you want to use for generating queries or reports in the FIELDS section.

List work item fields and attributes
Article • 11/22/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Work item fields are used to track information within Azure DevOps. These fields are
defined at the organization level and are shared across all projects in the organization.
To review the fields defined for your organization, you can use one of the following two
tools, available for both Inherited and Hosted XML process models:
Process > Fields web page
Work Item Field Explorer
For a description of each field defined with a system process, see Work item field index.
Permissions: To view the fields defined for an organization or collection, be a member of
the Project Collection Valid Users application group or have the View instance-level
information permission set to Allow for the organization or collection.
To list or review fields, use one of the following tools based on your process model—
Inherited, Hosted XML, or On-premises XML. For an index of fields defined within the
default processes, see Work item field index.

# Page 1631

Each work item type specifies the fields included in work items of that type. Each field
has multiple attributes, many of which are system-defined and immutable.
Fields get defined by the following three attributes:
Data type: Indicates the kind of data that can be entered into the field, such as
Boolean, Double, Integer, HTML, or String. For detailed descriptions of each data
type, see Query fields, operators, and macros.
Friendly name: The user-friendly name assigned to the field, used when selecting a
Field in a query clause. This name might differ from the name displayed on the
work item form.
Reference name: The identifier used when creating WIQL queries, improvised work
item templates, executing REST API commands, or defining XML work item type
definitions. The reference name is permanent and can't be changed once set.
For a detailed description of each field attribute and instructions on how to list them,
see Field attributes and List field attributes later in this article. For an overview of work
item types (WITs) and work items, refer to Track work with user stories, issues, bugs,
features, and epics.
Each work item type includes 31 system fields and several type-specific fields. Work
items are used to plan and track your project.
Each field captures specific information about the work to be performed. The values you
assign to these fields are stored in the work tracking data store, enabling you to create
queries that determine status and trends.
For descriptions and usage of each field defined for the core system processes—Agile,
Basic, Scrum, and CMMI—refer to the Work item field index.
A work item field name uniquely identifies each work item field. Ensure your field names
adhere to the following guidelines:
1. Only supported for default processes (Agile, CMMI, Scrum).
Field data types and names
What is a field? How are field names used?
Field names


# Page 1632

Uniqueness: Field names must be unique within the account or project collection.
Length: Field names must contain 128 Unicode characters or fewer.
Spacing: Field names can't have leading or trailing spaces or contain two or more
consecutive spaces.
Composition: Field names must include at least one alphabetic character.
Prohibited Characters: Field names can't include the following characters:
.,;' :~/*|?"&%$!+=()[]{}<>`.
Since custom fields are defined at the organization or collection level, you can't add a
custom field with the same name to multiple processes.
For more information, see Naming restrictions and conventions.
A work item field name uniquely identifies each field within Azure DevOps. Ensure your
field names comply with the following guidelines:
Uniqueness: Field names must be unique within an account or project collection.
Length: Field names must be 128 Unicode characters or fewer.
Spacing: Field names can't have leading or trailing spaces or contain multiple
consecutive spaces.
Composition: Field names must include at least one alphabetic character.
Prohibited Characters: Field names can't include the following characters:
.,;' :~/*|?"&%$!+=()[]{}<>`.
Since custom fields are defined at the organization or collection level, you can't add a
custom field with the same name to multiple processes.
For more information, see Naming restrictions and conventions.
Because custom fields are defined at the organization or project collection level, you
can't add a custom field with the same name to multiple processes.
When adding custom fields, note the following limits:
Maximum fields per work item type (WIT): 64
Maximum fields per process: 512
The field data type determines the kind and size of data that can be stored in the field.
Each field can have only one type defined within a project collection, encouraging the
System and predefined fields

use of common fields across different projects and work item types.
When you add a custom field to an inherited process, Azure DevOps assigns a reference
name prefixed with Custom followed by the field name without spaces. For example,
adding a field named DevOps Triage results in the reference name
Custom.DevOpsTriage. Spaces aren't allowed in reference names.
For more information, see Naming restrictions and conventions.
You can view the data type of fields defined for your organization by opening the
Process>Fields page.
To review the list of fields defined for an organization or collection, do the following
steps:
1. Select the 
 Azure DevOps logo to open Projects. Then choose Organization
settings.
How can I determine the field data type?

2. Select Process.


# Page 1635

3. Select Fields.
Fields listed correspond to all fields defined for the organization or collection,
which includes all custom fields and the fields defined for system processes.


# Page 1636

For descriptions, usage, and reference names of each field, refer to the Work item
field index. Additionally, you can retrieve field reference names using the Work
Item Types Field - List REST API.
You can look up the assignments of field attributes using the Work Item Field Explorer
tool.
７ Note
If you don't see Fields, then your collection uses the On-premises XML
process. The Fields page isn't supported for that process.
Work Item Field Explorer


# Page 1637

To access the Work Item Field Explorer, install the Process Editor Tool. Based on your
installed version of Visual Studio, get the Process Editor Tool from one of the following
extensions.
Visual Studio 2019 & 2022: As of now, there's no specific Process Template Editor
extension available. But, you can still customize process templates using other
tools such as any text editor or XML editor. You can also use the Azure DevOps
web portal for certain customizations, especially for inherited processes.
Visual Studio 2017: TFS Process Template Editor
. You can also use this version of
the Process Editor to modify the old-style work item forms. You can't use it to edit
forms associated with the new web forms.
Visual Studio 2015: TFS Power Tools
.
There are many nonchangeable and hidden attributes for each work item field. The
following table describes each attribute. Attributes have different names depending on
whether you retrieve them through the Fields - Get REST API or view them through the
Work Item Field Explorer (WIFE) tool.
Attributes assigned to a field depend on the platform and version you're using. For
example, some attributes aren't supported with the Inheritance process. To look up the
reference name for a field, see the Work item field index.

What is Agile?
Article • 11/28/2022
Agile is a term that describes approaches to software development that emphasize
incremental delivery, team
collaboration, continual planning, and continual learning. The
term Agile was coined in 2001 in the
Agile Manifesto
. The manifesto set out to
establish principles to guide a
better approach to software development. At its core, the
manifesto declares four value statements that represent
the foundation of the Agile
movement. As written, the manifesto states:
We have come to value:
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
Working software over comprehensive documentation.
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
Responding to change over following a plan.
The manifesto doesn't imply that the items on the right side of these statements
aren't
important or needed. Rather, items on the left are simply more
valued.
It's important to understand that Agile isn't a thing. You don't do Agile. Rather, Agile is a
mindset
that drives an approach to software development. Because there's no single
approach that works for all
situations, the term Agile has come to represent various
methods and practices that align with the
value statements in the manifesto.
Agile methods and practices


# Page 1661

Agile methods, which are often called frameworks, are comprehensive approaches to
phases of the DevOps lifecycle:
planning, development, delivery, and operations. They
prescribe a method for accomplishing work, with
clear guidance and principles.
Scrum is the most common Agile framework, and the one that most people start with.
Agile
practices, on the other hand, are techniques that are applied during phases of the
software development lifecycle.
Planning Poker
 is a collaborative estimation
practice that's designed to
encourage team members to share their understanding of what done means. Many
people
find the process fun, and it has proven to help foster teamwork and better
estimates.
Continuous integration (CI) is a common Agile
engineering practice that involves
integrating code changes into the main branch frequently. An automated build
verifies changes. As a result, there's a reduction in integration debt and a
continually shippable main branch.
These practices, like all Agile practices, carry the Agile label, because they're consistent
with the
principles in the Agile manifesto.
As Agile has gained popularity, many stereotypes and misinterpretations have cast a
negative shadow
on its effectiveness. It's easy to say "Yes, we're doing Agile," without any
accountability.
Keeping this point in mind, consider a few things that Agile isn't.
Agile isn't cowboy coding
. Agile shouldn't be confused
with a "we'll figure it out
as we go" approach to software development. Such an idea couldn't be further
from the
truth. Agile requires both a definition of done

and explicit value that's
delivered to customers in every sprint. While Agile values autonomy for individuals
and
teams, it emphasizes aligned autonomy to ensure that the increased
autonomy produces increased value.
Agile isn't without rigor and planning. On the contrary, Agile methodologies and
practices typically
emphasize discipline in planning. The key is continual planning
throughout the project, not just planning
up front. Continual planning ensures that
the team can learn from the work that they execute. Through this approach, they
maximize the return on investment (ROI) of planning.
"Plans are worthless, but planning is everything."
— Dwight D. Eisenhower
Agile isn't an excuse for the lack of a roadmap. This misconception has probably
done the most harm to
the Agile movement overall. Organizations and teams that
What Agile isn't


# Page 1662

follow an Agile approach absolutely know where
they're going and the results that
they want to achieve. Recognizing change as part of the process is
different from
pivoting in a new direction every week, sprint, or month.
Agile isn't development without specifications. It's necessary in any project to
keep your team aligned
on why and how work happens. An Agile approach to
specs includes ensuring that specs are right-sized,
and that they reflect
appropriately how the team sequences and delivers work.
Agile isn't incapable of accommodating unplanned work and other interruptions.
It's important to complete sprints on schedule. But just because an issue comes up
that sidetracks development doesn't mean that a sprint has to fail. Teams can plan
for interruptions by designating resources ahead of time for problems and
unexpected issues. Then they can address those issues but stay on track with
development.
Agile isn't inappropriate for large organizations. A common complaint is that
collaboration, a key component of Agile methodologies, is difficult in large teams.
Another gripe is that scalable approaches to Agile introduce structure and
methods that compromise flexibility. In spite of these misconceptions, it's possible
to scale Agile principles successfully. For information about overcoming these
difficulties, see Scaling Agile to large teams.
Agile isn't inefficient. To adapt to customers' changing needs, developers invest
time each iteration to demonstrate a working product and collect feedback. It's
true that these efforts reduce the time that they spend on development. But
incorporating customer requests early on saves significant time later. When
features stay aligned with the customer's vision, developers avoid major overhauls
down the line.
Agile isn't a poor fit for today's applications, which often center on data streaming.
Such projects typically involve more data modeling and extract-transform-load
(ETL) workloads than user interfaces. This fact makes it hard to demonstrate usable
software on a consistent, tight schedule. But by adjusting goals, developers can still
use an Agile approach. Instead of working to accomplish tasks each iteration,
developers can focus on running data experiments. Instead of presenting a
working product every few weeks, they can aim to better understand the data.
So why would anyone consider an Agile approach? It's clear that the rules of
engagement around building software
have fundamentally changed in the last 10-15
years. Many of the activities look similar, but the landscape
and environments where we
apply them are noticeably different.
Why Agile?


# Page 1663

Compare what it's like to purchase software today with the early 2000s. How often
do people drive to the store to buy business software?
Consider how feedback is collected from customers about products. How did a
team understand what people thought about their software before social media?
Consider how often a team desires to update and improve the software that they
deliver. Annual updates are no longer feasible against modern competition.
Forrester's Diego Lo Guidice says it best in his blog, Transforming Application Delivery
(October, 2020).
"Everything has dramatically changed. Sustainability, besides green and clean,
means that what we build today has to be easily and quickly changed tomorrow.
Strategic plans are short-term, and planning and change are continuous."
— Diego
Lo Guidice, Forrester
The rules have changed, and organizations around the world now adapt their approach
to software
development accordingly. Agile methods and practices don't promise to
solve every problem. But they do
promise to establish a culture and environment where
solutions emerge through collaboration, continual
planning and learning, and a desire
to ship high-quality software more often.
Deciding to take the Agile route to software development can introduce some
interesting opportunities
for enhancing your DevOps process. One key set of
considerations focuses on how
Agile development compares and contrasts with an
organization's current
approach.

What is Agile development?
Article • 11/28/2022
Agile development is a term that's used to describe iterative software development.
Iterative
software development shortens the DevOps life cycle by completing work in
short increments,
usually called sprints. Sprints are typically one to four weeks long.
Agile development is often contrasted
with traditional or waterfall development, which
plans larger projects up front and completes them according to the plan.
Delivering production quality code every sprint requires the Agile development team to
account for an
accelerated pace. All coding, testing, and quality verification must be
done each and every sprint. Unless
a team is properly set up, the results can fall short of
expectations. While these disappointments offer
great learning opportunities, it's helpful
to learn some key lessons before getting started.
This article lays out a few key success factors for Agile development teams:
Diligent backlog refinement
Integrating early and often
Minimizing technical debt
An Agile development team works off a backlog of requirements, which are often called
user stories. The backlog
is prioritized, with the most important user stories at the top.
The product owner owns the backlog and
adds, changes, and reprioritizes user stories
based on the customer's needs.
Diligent backlog refinement


# Page 1665

One of the biggest drags on an Agile team's productivity is a poorly defined backlog. A
team can't be
expected to consistently deliver high quality software each sprint unless
they have clearly defined requirements.
The product owner's job is to ensure that every sprint, the engineers have clearly
defined user stories to
work with. The user stories at the top of the backlog should
always be ready for the team to start on.
This notion is called backlog refinement.
Keeping a backlog ready for an Agile development team requires effort
and discipline.
Fortunately, it's well worth the investment.
When you refine a backlog, remember the following key considerations.
1. Refining user stories is often a long-lead activity. Elegant user interfaces, beautiful
screen designs, and customer-delighting solutions all take time and
energy to
create. Diligent product owners refine user stories two to three sprints in advance.
They account for
design iterations and customer reviews. They work to ensure
every user story is something the Agile team
is proud to deliver to the customer.
2. A user story isn't refined unless the team says it is. The team needs to review the
user story and agree it's ready to work on. If a team doesn't see the user
story until
day one of a sprint, problems can likely result.
3. User stories further down the backlog can remain ambiguous. Don't waste time
refining lower-priority items. Focus on the top of the backlog.
Continuous integration and
continuous delivery (CI/CD) set up your team for the fast
pace of Agile development. As soon as possible, automate the build, test, and
deployment pipelines.
Set up that automation as one of the first tasks your team tackles
when you start a new project.
With automation, the team avoids slow, error-prone, and time-intensive manual
deployment processes.
Since teams release every sprint, there isn't time to do these
tasks manually.
CI/CD also influences your software architecture. It ensures you deliver buildable and
deployable software.
When teams implement a difficult-to-deploy feature, they become
aware immediately if the build and
deployments fail. CI/CD forces a team to fix
deployment issues as they occur. The product is then
always ready to ship.
Integrate early and often


# Page 1666

There are some key CI/CD activities that are critically important for effective Agile
development.
1. Unit testing. Unit tests are the first defense against human error. Consider unit
tests a part of coding. Check tests
in with the code. Make unit testing a part of
every build. Failed unit tests mean a
failed build.
2. Build automation. The build system should automatically pull code and tests
directly from source
control when builds run.
3. Branch and build policies. Configure branch and build policies to build
automatically as the team
checks code in to a specific branch.
4. Deploy to an environment. Set up a release pipeline that automatically deploys
built projects to
an environment that mimics production.
With personal finances, it's easier to stay out of debt than to dig out from under it. The
same rule
applies with technical debt. Technical debt includes anything that the team
must address because of shortcuts that were taken earlier. For instance, if you're on a
tight schedule, you might sacrifice quality to meet a deadline. Technical debt is the price
you pay later, when you have to refactor code to make up for that lack of quality.
Examples include fixes to address poor design, bugs, performance issues, operational
issues, accessibility concerns, and other issues.
Keeping on top of technical debt requires courage. There are many pressures to delay
reworking code.
It feels good to work on features and ignore debt. Unfortunately,
somebody must pay off the technical debt
sooner or later. Just like financial debt,
Minimize technical debt


# Page 1667

technical debt becomes harder to pay off the longer it exists.
A smart product owner
works with their team to ensure there's time to pay off technical debt every sprint.
Balancing technical debt reduction with feature development is a difficult task.
Fortunately, there are some
straightforward techniques for creating productive,
customer-focused teams.
Being Agile means learning from experience and continually improving. Agile
development provides more
learning cycles than traditional project planning due to the
tighter process loops. Each sprint provides
something new for the team to learn.
For example:
A team delivers value to the customer, gets feedback, and then modifies their
backlog based on that feedback.
They learn that their automated builds are missing key tests. They include work in
their next sprint to address this issue.
They find that certain features perform poorly in production, so they make plans to
improve performance.
Someone on the team hears of a new practice. The team decides to try it out for a
few sprints.
Teams that are just starting with Agile development should expect more learning
opportunities. They're an
invaluable part of the process because they lead to growth
and improvement.
There are many ways to settle on an Agile development process that's right for a team.
Azure DevOps provides
various process templates. Teams that are looking for different
baseline
structures to their planning can use these templates as starting points.
For
information about selecting a process template that best fits a team's culture and goals,
see Choose a process flow or process template to work in Azure Boards.
As organizations grow, it can be a challenge to stay disciplined. Learn more about
scaling Agile to large teams.

Building productive teams
Article • 11/28/2022
Engineers thrive in environments where they can focus and get in the zone. Teams often
face distractions and competing priorities that force engineers to shift context and
divide their attention. They struggle to balance heads down time with heads up time.
Adding new features requires team members to be heads down and focused.
Responding to customer issues and addressing live site issues requires the team to be
heads up and aware of what's going on.
To mitigate distractions, a team can divide itself into two crews: one for features and one
for live site health.
The two-crew approach yields greater productivity and predictability. Successful
implementation relies on these key elements:
Clearly defined crew roles
A well-defined crew rotation process
Frequent adjustments to crew size
The feature crew, or F-crew, focuses on the future. They work as an effective unit with a
clear mission and goal: to build and ship high-quality features.
The F-crew is shielded from the day-to-day chaos of the live service to ensure they have
time to design, build, and test their work. They can rely on minimal distractions and
Feature crew


# Page 1669

freedom from having to fix issues that arise at random. They're encouraged to seldom
check their email and avoid getting pulled into other issues unless they're critical.
When an F-crew member joins a conversation or occasionally gets sucked into an email
thread, other team members should chide them: "You're on the F-crew, what are you
doing?" If an F-crew member needs to address a critical issue, they're encouraged to
delegate it to the customer crew and return to feature work.
The F-crew operates as a tight-knit team that swarms on a small set of features. A good
work-in-progress (WIP) limit is two features in flight for 4-6 people. By working closely
together, they build deep shared context and find critical bugs or design issues that a
cursory code review would miss. A dedicated crew allows for a more predictable
throughput rate and lead time. Team members often refer to the F-crew as serene and
focused. They find it peaceful and rejuvenating to focus deeply on a feature, to dedicate
full attention to it. People leave their time on the F-crew feeling refreshed and
accomplished.
The customer crew, or C-crew, focuses on the now and provides frontline support for
customer and
live-site issues, bugs, telemetry, and monitoring. The C-crew often
huddles around a computer, debugging a
critical live-site issue. Their number one
priority is live-site health. Laser-focused on this environment,
they build expert
debugging and analysis skills. The customer crew is often referred to as the shield
team,
because it shields the rest of the team from distractions. Rather than work on upcoming
features,
the C-crew is the bridge between customers and the current product. Crew
members are active on email, Twitter, and
other feedback channels. Customers want to
know they're heard, and the C-crew's job is to hear them. The
C-crew triages customer-
reported issues immediately and quickly engages and assists blocked customers.
With a deluge of incoming tasks, working on a fast-paced C-crew can, at times, be
exhilarating. In a busy
week, they address multiple emails, live-site investigations, and
bugs. As operations quiet down, they work
to improve telemetry and reporting,
investing their time to make service upkeep easier.
C-crews allow the team to address issues without pulling team members off other
priorities, and ensure
customers and partners are heard. Responsiveness to questions
and issues becomes a point of pride for
C-crews. However, this pace can be draining,
necessitating a frequent rotation between crews.
Customer crew
Crew rotation


# Page 1670

A well-defined rotation process makes the two-crew system work. You could simply
swap the crews (F-crew
becomes C-crew and vice versa), but this limits knowledge
sharing between and within the crews. Instead,
opt for a weekly rotation.
At the end of each week, conduct a short swap meet where the team decides who swaps
between crews. You
can use a whiteboard chart to track who is currently on each crew
and when they were swapped. The
longest tenured people on each crew should
typically swap with each other. However, in any given week,
someone may want to
remain to complete work on a live-site investigation or feature. While there's
flexibility,
the longer someone is on a crew, the more likely they should be swapped.
Weekly rotations help prevent silos of knowledge in the team and ensure a constant
flow of information
and perspective between crews. The frequent movement of
engineers creates shared knowledge of the team's
work, which helps the C-crew to
resolve issues without the help of others. Often, new F-crew members
will quickly find a
previously overlooked design or code flaw.
Crew size varies to maintain the health of the team. If a team has a high incoming rate
of live-site issues
or has a lot of technical debt, the C-crew gets larger, and vice versa.
Adjusting sizes weekly increases
predictability in the team's deliverables and
dependencies. In some weeks, a team may move everyone to the
C-crew to address the
feedback from a big release.
This strategy simplifies communication with management. Without a two-crew system,
engineers often work on
multiple things simultaneously. When several distractions occur
in a single week, in-progress features are
often delayed. As a result, a team may be
unable to confidently give timelines for future feature work.
A dedicated F-crew leads to predictable throughput and lead time. Splitting resources
between crews
increases accountability within the team and with management about
what the team can accomplish each week
and each sprint.
The two-crew system can help teams understand where engineers should spend their
time and to make progress on many competing priorities.
In addition to improving productivity and predictability, the two-crew system can
increase team morale. Engineers on each team clearly understand their roles and
responsibilities and function more independently and with much greater accountability.

What is Scrum?
Article • 11/28/2022
Scrum is a framework used by teams to manage work and solve problems
collaboratively in short cycles. Scrum implements the principles of Agile as a concrete
set of artifacts, practices, and roles.
The diagram below details the iterative Scrum lifecycle. The entire lifecycle is completed
in fixed time periods called sprints. A sprint is typically one-to-four weeks long.
There are three key roles in Scrum: the product owner, the Scrum master, and the
development team.
The product owner is responsible for what the team builds, and why they build it. The
product owner is responsible for keeping the backlog of work up to date and in priority
order.
The Scrum master ensures that the Scrum process is followed by the team. Scrum
masters are continually on the lookout for how the team can improve, while also
resolving impediments and other blocking issues that arise during the sprint. Scrum
masters are part coach, part team member, and part cheerleader.

The members of the development team actually build the product. The team owns the
engineering of the product, and the quality that goes with it.
The product backlog is a prioritized list of work the team can deliver. The product owner
is responsible for adding, changing, and reprioritizing the backlog as needed. The items
at the top of the backlog should always be ready for the team to execute on.
In sprint planning, the team chooses backlog items to work on in the upcoming sprint.
The team chooses backlog items based on priority and what they believe they can
complete in the sprint. The sprint backlog is the list of items the team plans to deliver in
the sprint. Often, each item on the sprint backlog is broken down into tasks. Once all
members agree the sprint backlog is achievable, the sprint starts.
Once the sprint starts, the team executes on the sprint backlog. Scrum does not specify
how the team should execute. The team decides how to manage its own work.
Scrum defines a practice called a daily Scrum, often called the daily standup. The daily
Scrum is a daily meeting limited to fifteen minutes. Team members often stand during
the meeting to ensure it stays brief. Each team member briefly reports their progress
since yesterday, the plans for today, and anything impeding their progress.
To aid the daily Scrum, teams often review two artifacts:
The task board lists each backlog item the team is working on, broken down into the
tasks required to complete it. Tasks are placed in To do, In progress, and Done columns
based on their status. The board provides a visual way to track the progress of each
backlog item.

The sprint burndown is a graph that plots the daily total of remaining work, typically
shown in hours. The burndown chart provides a visual way of showing whether the team
is on track to complete all the work by the end of the sprint.
At the end of the sprint, the team performs two practices:
The team demonstrates what they've accomplished to stakeholders. They demo the
software and show its value.
The team takes time to reflect on what went well and which areas need improvement.
The outcome of the retrospective are actions for the next sprint.
The product of a sprint is called the increment or potentially shippable increment.
Regardless of the term, a sprint's output should be of shippable quality, even if it's part

of something bigger and can't ship by itself. It should meet all the quality criteria set by
the team and product owner.
The entire cycle is repeated for the next sprint. Sprint planning selects the next items on
the product backlog and the cycle repeats. While the team executes the sprint, the
product owner ensures the items at the top of the backlog are ready to execute in the
following sprint.
This shorter, iterative cycle provides the team with lots of opportunities to learn and
improve. A traditional project often has a long lifecycle, say 6-12 months. While a team
can learn from a traditional project, the opportunities are far less than a team who
executes in two-week sprints, for example.
This iterative cycle is, in many ways, the essence of Agile.
Scrum is very popular because it provides just enough framework to guide teams while
giving them flexibility in how they execute. Its concepts are simple and easy to learn.
Teams can get started quickly and learn as they go. All of this makes Scrum a great
choice for teams just starting to implement Agile principles.

Add, rename, and delete dashboards in
Azure DevOps
Article • 01/09/2025
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Share progress and status with your team using configurable team or project
dashboards. Dashboards provide easy-to-read, easy access, real-time information. At a
glance, you can make informed decisions without having to drill down into other parts
of your project.
When a project is first created, a default team and default team dashboard is created
labeled Overview. You can customize this dashboard by adding widgets. Each widget
provides access to one or more features or functions. For more information about each
widget, see Widget catalog.
When you add a dashboard, you can choose to make it a project dashboard or one
specific to a team. Use project dashboards to display information or status about the
project or when you want to control who can edit the dashboard. Use team dashboards
to focus information specific to a team.
Access:
Anyone with project access, including Stakeholders, can view dashboards.
At least Basic access, or specific dashboard permissions.
Project and team dashboards
７ Note
Project dashboards are owned by the person that created the dashboard. The
owner can set permissions as to who can edit the dashboard. Team dashboards are
owned by team administrators and can be edited by any member of the team. All
dashboards can be viewed by members of the project. All widgets available to team
dashboards are available for project dashboards. For team-specific widgets, if you
aren't able to select a team through the widget, then the team defaults to the
default project team.
Prerequisites


# Page 1677

Permissions:
Team dashboards: To add, edit, or manage a team dashboard, meet the
following requirements:
Be a member of the team.
Be a member of the Project Administrators group.
All dashboards are associated with either a team or a project. From the
Overview>Dashboards page, you can browse all dashboards and see which team they
belong to, or if they are project dashboard.
Open a web browser, connect to your project, and select Overview>Dashboards. The
dashboard directory page opens.
It lists dashboards in the following order:
Your last visited dashboard
Your favorited dashboards
７ Note
Data displayed within a chart or widget is subject to the permissions granted to the
signed-in user. For example, if a user doesn't have permissions to view work items
under a specific area path, those items don't display in a query results widget on
the dashboard. For more information, see FAQs about using dashboards.

Terms and concepts used when tracking
work items in Azure Boards
Article • 02/01/2024
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
The Microsoft Agile glossary is a short dictionary of terms used in tracking work using
Azure Boards. More terms are defined in the following articles:
Kanban key concepts
Sprints and Scrum key concepts
Work item field index
Project management and navigation glossary
A family of engineering best processes with a goal of enabling rapid delivery of high-
quality software and a business approach that aligns development with customer needs
and company goals. In this paradigm, frequent inspection and adaptation are necessary,
with team work, self-organization, and accountability all critical to project success.
A suite of web-based tools used to track work and support Agile methodologies. Agile
tools support the core Agile methods—Scrum and Kanban—used by software
development teams today. Learn more: About Agile tools and Agile project
management.
Area paths are used to group work items by team, product, or feature area. Iteration
paths are used to group work into sprints, milestones, or other event-specific or time-
related periods. You can use area paths to define a hierarchy of paths. To learn more, see
About area and iteration paths.
Agile methods
Agile tools
Area path
Bugs


# Page 1702

A type of work item that records a potential source of dissatisfaction with the product.
The common name of a work item type for tracking code defects. Each team can choose
how they want to manage bugs. Some teams like to track bugs along with requirements
on the backlog. Other teams like to track bugs as tasks performed in support of a
requirement. The bugs then appear on their Taskboard. Learn more: Manage bugs.
Groups one or more work item types to support flexible reporting, queries, and other
functions made available through Agile tools. Categories support the process
configuration used by the web portal backlog and taskboard pages. For example, you
can add custom work item types to the Requirements category and manage them using
the product backlog and boards. For more information, see Use categories to group
work item types.
A collection is a container for a number of projects in Azure DevOps. A default collection
is created when you sign up with Azure DevOps Services or install Team Foundation
Server. Within Azure DevOps Services, a collection corresponds to an organization. For
on-premises TFS deployments, you can add and manage collections to specify the
logical and physical resources available to the projects within the collection.
Learn more: About projects and scaling your organization, Manage organizations or
Manage project collections in Team Foundation Server.
Dashboards are user-configurable interactive signboards that provide real-time
information. Dashboards are associated with a team and display configurable widgets to
show information. To learn more, see Add and manage dashboards.
Area within a work item form that supports adding and reviewing comments made
about the work being performed. This way, you capture all comments within the work
item rather than maintaining a long email thread. Within the discussion section, you can
use the @mention control to notify another team member about the discussion. Simply
type @ and their name.

Tagging an object as a favorite is a method used to support quick navigation by yourself
or other team members. You can tag work item queries and build definitions as personal
and team favorites. Other objects you can tag as a favorite for yourself only include
code branches, delivery plans, test plans, and teams or projects. To learn more, see Set
personal or team favorites.
Fields support tracking a piece of information about the work to perform. Values you
assign to a field are stored in the work tracking data store that you can query and
generate charts to view status and trends. Your project contains 100 or more data fields.
You update data by modifying the data field within a work item. Each work item is
associated with a work item type (WIT), and the data you can track corresponds to the
fields assigned to the WIT. For a definition of each predefined field, see Work item field
index.
Tagging specific work items or pull requests to follow them is a method used to receive
email updates about changes that are made to them. To learn more, see Follow a work
item or pull request.
Defines a list of menu items or picklist items that are shared across WITs and projects
within a project collection. Global lists help to minimize the work that is required to
update lists. You can define global lists within WITs that you upload with your process
template. Learn more: Manage global lists for work item types. (Only supported for
Hosted XML and On-premises XML process models)
Specifies both work item fields and global lists that multiple projects and types of work
items can share. Learn more: Manage global workflow (Only supported for On-premises

Specifies the set of work item types that you don't want users to create manually. By
default this set includes:
Code Review Request and Code Review Response
Feedback Request and Feedback Response
Shared Steps and Shared Parameter
Test Plan and Test Suite
You can use TFS Team Project Manager
, an open-source client available from GitHub
to quickly determine which WITs belong to the Hidden Types Category.
The Hosted XML process model provides support for customizing work tracking objects
and Agile tools for a project by modifying and importing a process template. This
process model is only available for select accounts hosted on the Azure Boards cloud
platform. For more information, see Hosted process model.
A type of work item that helps track unplanned activities. Resolving an issue or
impediment requires more work beyond what was scheduled based on actual
requirements. Using the issue (Agile or CMMI process) or impediment (Scrum process)
work item type helps you track and manage these issues until you can resolve and close
them. Learn more: Manage issues and impediments.
The Inheritance process model provides support for customizing work tracking objects
and Agile tools for a project through the user interface. This process model is only
available for accounts hosted on the Azure Boards cloud platform. Projects inherit the
customizations made to a process. For more information, see Inheritance process model.
Agile process: An issue is a type of work item that defines an item that you want to track
as it may impact the completion of other work. It's defined for the Agile process and
doesn't appear on any backlog or board. See Manage issues and impediments.

Basic process: An issue is a type of work item that defines some work or code defect
that needs to be tracked. It's defined for the Basic process and appears on the product
backlog and Issues board.
A time period, usually two to three weeks, used to group work items to be completed
during that time period. Sprints are used in Scrum methods to support sprint planning,
sprint burndown, and other Scrum processes. Iteration paths allow you to group work
into sprints, milestones, or other event-specific or time-related period. Learn more:
About area and iteration paths.
An interactive, electronic sign board that supports visualization of the flow of work from
concept to completion and lean methods. Azure DevOps provides a board for each
product and portfolio backlog. For more information, see Board overview and Board
features and epics.
Links support defining relationships between work items and other objects—such as
commits, branches, pull requests, and more—using different link types. For more
information, see Link work items to other objects and Link types reference.
The On-premises XML process model provides support for customizing work tracking
objects and Agile tools for a project. With this model, you can update the XML definition
of work item types, the process configuration, categories, and more. You can also
update the attributes of fields. This process model is only available for on-premises
Azure DevOps. For more information, see On-premises process model.
A picklist specifies an enumerated set of values that appear within a drop-down menu in
a work item form. Values also appear in the Value column within the query editor. The
method you use to customize a picklist varies. It depends on the field and the process
model. For more information, see Customize work.

A plan is a configurable view that displays work from multiple teams and projects laid
out within a calendar based on each team's iterations. Each row in the view represents
the work from a team's product or portfolio backlog. Each card corresponds to a work
item, such as user story, feature, or epic. To learn more, see Review team delivery plans.
An interactive list of work items, similar to the product backlog, that supports organizing
or grouping work under features, epics, or scenarios. Portfolio backlogs work similarly to
product backlogs in that you can prioritize work and view the tree hierarchy of work.
Learn more: Define features and epics.
A process defines the building blocks of a work-tracking system. To customize a process,
you first create an inherited process from one of the default system processes, Agile,
Scrum, or CMMI. All projects that use the process see the changes you make. To learn
more, see About process customization and inherited processes.
Specifies the default configuration and functional capabilities that your teams can access
using the Agile tools. These web portal tools include the product backlog, sprint
backlogs, board, and taskboard. (Only supported for Hosted XML and On-premises XML
process models)
The work tracking customization method supported by your organization or collection.
One of three process models are supported, Inheritance and Hosted XML for Azure
Boards and On-premises XML for on-premises Azure DevOps. Learn more: Customize
your work tracking experience
Specifies an inter-related set of files that contain the XML definitions for tracking work
and defining the initial configuration of other functional areas. The system provides

three default process templates—Agile, Scrum, or CMMI. You can create a project and
then customize it, or customize a process template that you then use to create a project.
(Only supported for Hosted XML and On-premises XML process models)
An interactive list of work items that corresponds to a team's project plan or roadmap
for what the team plans to deliver. The product backlog supports prioritizing work,
forecasting work by sprints, and quickly linking work to portfolio backlog items. You can
define your backlog items and then manage their status using the board.
Each product backlog can be customized by a team. Learn more: Create your backlog.
A type of work item that defines the applications, requirements, and elements that
teams plan to create. Product owners typically define and stack rank product backlog
items which are defined with the Scrum process. Learn more: Scrum process work item
types and workflow.
A project, which was previously known as a team project, provides a repository for
source code. A project provides a place where a group of people can plan, track
progress, and collaborate on building software solutions. A project is defined for an
Azure DevOps Services organization or within a TFS project collection. You can use it to
focus on those objects defined within the project. To learn more, see About projects and
scaling your organization.
Queries are used to find and list work items. Queries support managed searches, which
are used to triage work, versus ad-hoc searches, which are used to find a specific work
item. Flat-list queries also support status and trend charts. To learn more, see About
managed queries.

Remote linking


# Page 1708

With remote linking, you can create link relationships between work items in one
organization to work items or other objects defined in another organization.
Organizations must be managed by the same Microsoft Entra ID. Learn more: Link work
items, Link to a remote work item.
Rollup refers to the sum of Remaining Work, Story Points, or other numeric field of child
and descendent work items within a hierarchy. To add rollup columns to a product or
portfolio backlog, see Display rollup progress or totals.
A sprint is a time period of usually two to three weeks that's used to group work items
to be completed during that time period. Sprints are used in Scrum methods to support
sprint planning, sprint burndown, and other Scrum processes. Sprints are defined via
iteration paths. To learn more, see About area and iteration paths (aka sprints).
An interactive list of work items that have been assigned to the same sprint or iteration
path for a team. The sprint backlog supports teams that use Scrum methodologies.
Learn more: Sprint planning.
A taskboard is an interactive board of work items that you can use to review and update
tasks defined for the sprint backlog. The taskboard supports teams that use Scrum
methodologies. To learn more, see Update and monitor your taskboard.
A team corresponds to a selected set of project members. With teams, organizations
can subcategorize work to better focus on all the work they track within a project. Each
team gets access to a suite of Agile tools. Teams can use these tools to work
autonomously and collaborate with other teams across the enterprise. Each team can
configure and customize each tool to meet their work requirements. To learn more, see
About teams and Agile tools.

A type of work item that defines the applications, requirements, and elements that
teams plan to create. Product owners typically define and stack rank user stories. User
story is defined with the Agile process. Learn more: Agile process work item types and
workflow.
Widgets display information and charts on dashboards. Many of them can be
configured. Many widgets display information available from one or more data stores or
charts created by the system. To learn more, see Widget catalog.
A WIT specifies the fields, workflow, and form used to track an item of work. Each WIT is
associated with more than 30 system fields and several more type-specific fields. You
use work items to plan and track the work required to develop your project. For an
overview of predefined WITs provided with the default processes, see About processes
and process templates.
A workflow is an integral aspect of a work item. It's defined by its corresponding work
item type. The workflow determines the logical progression and regression of work
items. For the Agile process, it tracks the status of work as the work progresses from a
New or Active state to a Closed or Completed state. For the Basic process, all work item
types use the To Do, Doing, and Done states to track workflow status.
The workflow also specifies the values that appear in the State and Reason drop-down
menus. For more information, see Workflow states and state categories.
